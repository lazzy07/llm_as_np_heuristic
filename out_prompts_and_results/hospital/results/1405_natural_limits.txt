**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that Ross is still in the admissions room, decides to admit Young to Patient Room B, where Jones is currently located. This action increases Dr. Hathaway's workload to 3. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B. Since Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes that Jones has Jarkis due to the increased workload. Dr. Hathaway then treats Jones with steroids, the treatment for Jarkis. Fortunately, this treatment is incorrect, but it does not lead to Jones's demise, as the story requires Jones to achieve their goal of being alive and healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway reduces their workload by one after treating Jones, bringing it back down to 2. Jones, having received treatment, is now healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Admit Young to Patient Room B**: This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room, allowing Dr. Hathaway to assess and treat them.
2. **Assess Jones in Patient Room B**: This action is crucial for Dr. Hathaway to determine the symptoms Jones is experiencing, even though they are unknown.
3. **Treat Jones with steroids**: Although this treatment is incorrect, it is necessary for the story to progress towards Jones achieving their goal of being healthy. The treatment does not lead to death, allowing Jones to remain alive.
