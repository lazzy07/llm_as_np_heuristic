To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **Bubba goes to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to take the money.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, fulfilling his desire to have money.

3. **Bubba goes to the forest.**  
   - This action is not strictly necessary for the goal but allows Bubba to leave the bank after stealing the money, potentially avoiding confrontation.

4. **Bubba shoots Bambi.**  
   - This action is taken to fulfill the condition of Bambi being dead, which is one of the possible endings.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Going to the bank** allows Bubba to access the clerk and the money he desires.
- **Stealing the money** directly fulfills Bubba's goal of obtaining money.
- **Going to the forest** is a strategic move to escape after the theft, although it is not essential for achieving the goal.
- **Shooting Bambi** ensures that the second condition of the ending (Bambi being dead) is met.
