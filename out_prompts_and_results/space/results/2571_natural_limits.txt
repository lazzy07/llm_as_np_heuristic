Zoe, realizing the danger of the surface and wanting to ensure the Lizard's safety, decides to teleport to the surface to check on the Lizard. She hopes to make a friend and help the Lizard understand that they can work together for mutual safety.

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to reach the Lizard and assess the situation on the surface. By doing this, she can directly interact with the Lizard and potentially form a friendship.

Upon arriving on the surface, Zoe finds the Lizard and sees that it is in a precarious position due to the volcanic activity. She approaches the Lizard and speaks to it, expressing her desire to be friends and work together to stay safe.

2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** - This action is crucial as it allows Zoe and the Lizard to establish a friendly relationship. By making peace, they can collaborate to ensure their safety and health, fulfilling both of their goals.
