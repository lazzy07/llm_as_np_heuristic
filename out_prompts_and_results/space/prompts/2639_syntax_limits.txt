 I will describe a setting and the first part of a story. Your job is to complete the story to ensure it has a specific ending. 

There are three locations in this story: a spaceship orbiting a planet, the surface of the planet, and a cave on the planet. There are two characters in the story. Zoe is a space explorer and captain of the spaceship. Zoe wants to be healthy and safe and to make friends with other creatures. The Lizard is an alien creature that is the guardian of the planet. The Lizard wants to be healthy and safe and to make friends with other creatures. There are ten kinds of actions characters can take in the story. Zoe can teleport from the spaceship to the surface of the planet. Zoe can teleport from the surface of the planet to the spaceship, but this makes the Lizard angry. A character can walk between locations on the planet. Two characters who are in the same location can begin a fight, which causes them to be enemies. A fight automatically ends if a character is stunned, killed, or leaves the location where the fight is happening. One character can stun another character that they are fighting. A stunned character cannot take any actions except to break free. A stunned character can break free from being stunned, and after breaking free can act again. One character can kill another character that they are fighting. Two characters can become friends if they are not fighting. A volcano on the surface of the planet can start erupting at any time. A volcano on the surface which has started erupting can finish erupting, which kills any characters that are on the surface of the planet.

 

 Available actions for you are : 
teleport_from_ship(character : character, from : ship, to : landform),teleport_to_ship(character : character, from : landform, to : ship),walk(character : character, from : place, to : place),attack(attacker : character, victim : character, place : place),stun(stunner : character, victim : character, place : place),kill(killer : character, victim : character, place : place),break_free(character : character, place : place),make_peace(peacemaker : character, other : character, place : place),begin_erupt(place : landform),erupt(place : landform)


 These events have already happened in the story: 
begin_erupt(Surface); teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface); walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface); teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship); teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface); walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave); walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave); erupt(Surface)


 This is the current situation after those events:
at(Zoe) = Cave; at(Lizard) = Cave; fighting(Zoe, Lizard) = False; fighting(Lizard, Zoe) = False; guardian(Lizard, Surface) = True; relationship(Zoe, Lizard) = 0; relationship(Lizard, Zoe) = -1; safe(Zoe) = True; safe(Lizard) = True; status(Zoe) = Healthy; status(Lizard) = Healthy; status(Surface) = Uninhabitable; believes(Zoe, at(Zoe)) = Cave; believes(Zoe, at(Lizard)) = Cave; believes(Zoe, guardian(Lizard, Surface)) = False; believes(Zoe, status(Zoe)) = Healthy; believes(Zoe, status(Lizard)) = Healthy; believes(Zoe, status(Surface)) = Dangerous; believes(Lizard, at(Zoe)) = Cave; believes(Lizard, at(Lizard)) = Cave; believes(Lizard, status(Zoe)) = Healthy; believes(Lizard, status(Lizard)) = Healthy; believes(Lizard, status(Surface)) = Dangerous; 


 Complete the story using only these locations, items, characters, and actions. Do not invent new locations, items, characters, or actions. Characters should only take actions that help to achieve their goals, and the story should only include actions which are necessary to achieve the ending. Give me the shortest story 

that ends with the volcano on the surface erupting, a character dying, two characters making friends, or any combination of these things.


 Explain why each action is in the story. After the explanation of the whole story, give a JSON object with the final plan. The JSON should include an array called 'plan' with the sequence of actions (as a string) taken to achieve the goal. Example format: {plan: ['action1', 'action2', 'action3']}.

 While keeping the story complete, a smaller story is preferred. Suggested maximum number of the actions in the story: 4.
