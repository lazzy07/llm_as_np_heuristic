1. **Assess Ross in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway will have to make a decision based on the information available. 

2. **Treat Ross in Patient Room A**: After assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway decides to treat him with antibiotics, assuming he might have Flaze, as it is the only disease that can be treated with antibiotics.
