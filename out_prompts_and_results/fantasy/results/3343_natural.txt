To achieve Talia's goal of being happy and wealthy, the story will focus on her actions in the cave, where she is currently located with Rory and Gargax. The key actions will involve Talia acquiring the treasure and ensuring her happiness through her marriage to Rory.

### Story Completion:

1. **Talia picks up the treasure.**  
   - This action is necessary for Talia to become wealthy, as the treasure is located in the cave.

2. **Gargax eats Rory.**  
   - This action is necessary because it removes Rory from the story, allowing Talia to focus on her own happiness without the complication of her marriage to Rory. Since Talia's happiness is currently at 0, this action will not affect her directly but will allow her to pursue her goals without Rory's presence.

3. **Talia's happiness increases.**  
   - With Rory gone, Talia can now focus on her own desires and ambitions, leading to an increase in her happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Picking up the treasure** is essential for Talia to achieve her goal of being wealthy. Since she is already married to Rory, this action solidifies her wealth.
- **Gargax eating Rory** simplifies the situation for Talia, allowing her to focus on her own happiness without the need to maintain a relationship with Rory, who is no longer a factor in her life.
