Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess Jones and Ross, who are currently in the admissions room.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones.**  
   - By assessing Jones, Dr. Hathaway can determine if he has Flaze or Jarkis, which is crucial for providing the correct treatment.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross.**  
   - Similarly, assessing Ross allows Dr. Hathaway to identify his condition and provide appropriate treatment.

4. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B.**  
   - After assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway can assign him to an exam room for treatment.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room B.**  
   - Assuming Ross has been diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Dr. Hathaway treats him with steroids, ensuring he becomes healthy.

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully assesses and treats both patients, achieving the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
