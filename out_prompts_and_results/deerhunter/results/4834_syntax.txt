Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants to obtain money from the clerk.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go back to the house. This action is necessary for Bubba to secure his stolen money in a safe place.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the clerk's money at gunpoint, fulfilling his greed for money.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: This action allows Bubba to escape with the stolen money, ensuring he is no longer in the bank where he could be caught.
