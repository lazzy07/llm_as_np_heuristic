**Story Completion:**

Blake looks around the living room and sees the jewelry on the table. Knowing that Alex wants the jewelry, Blake decides to take the jewelry and give it to Alex. 

1. **Blake picks up the jewelry in the living room.** (This action is necessary because Blake needs to acquire the jewelry to help Alex achieve their goal.)
2. **Blake gives the jewelry to Alex in the living room.** (This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.)

Now, Alex has the jewelry and is happy. Blake, having given away the jewelry, is now left with the chocolates, which is what Blake wanted all along. 

**Final Situation:**
- Alex is happy (has the jewelry).
- Blake is happy (has the chocolates).
- Casey is still unhappy (wants the jewelry but does not have it).

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Blake's actions were focused on helping Alex achieve their goal of happiness by giving them the jewelry. This also indirectly leads to Blake's own happiness since they now have the chocolates.
