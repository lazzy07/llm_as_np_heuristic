**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to first assess Jones in Patient Room C. 

1. **Assess Jones in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes that Jones has Jarkis instead of Flaze. 

2. **Treat Jones in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, believing he has Jarkis. However, since Jones is actually healthy, he remains alive and healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway returns to the admissions room to admit Young, who is still waiting.

3. **Walk from Patient Room C to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to admit Young.

4. **Admit Young to Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room A.

5. **Walk from Admissions to Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room A to assess Young.

6. **Assess Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is also experiencing an unknown symptom. Again, due to her workload, she mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis.

7. **Treat Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, believing he has Jarkis. Young remains alive and healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to Patient Room B to assess and treat Ross.

8. **Walk from Patient Room A to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room B.

9. **Assess Ross in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to her workload, she mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis.

10. **Treat Ross in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, believing he has Jarkis. Ross remains alive and healthy.

At the end of these actions, all patients are alive and healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each assessment and treatment is necessary to determine the patients' conditions and provide care.
- The walking actions are necessary for Dr. Hathaway to move between rooms to assess and treat each patient.
- The mistaken beliefs due to high workload lead to the same treatment being applied to all patients, which fortuitously keeps them all healthy.
