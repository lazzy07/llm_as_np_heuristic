To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because Young's health status is currently unknown, and identifying any symptoms is crucial for proper treatment.

2. **Treat Young with Antibiotics**: If Young is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat them with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is essential to ensure Young becomes healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Young, Hathaway will walk to the admissions room to assess Jones, who is currently in the admissions room. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are attended to and to help Jones achieve their goal of being healthy.

4. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine their symptoms. This is important to identify if Jones has Flaze or Jarkis.

5. **Treat Jones with the appropriate treatment**: Depending on the symptoms identified during the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with either antibiotics (if diagnosed with Flaze) or steroids (if diagnosed with Jarkis). This ensures that Jones also has a chance to become healthy.

Here’s the complete sequence of actions:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: This identifies Young's symptoms.
2. **Treat Young with Antibiotics**: If Young has Flaze, this will make them healthy.
3. **Walk to Admissions**: Hathaway moves to attend to Jones.
4. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: This identifies Jones's symptoms.
5. **Treat Jones with the appropriate treatment**: This ensures Jones can also become healthy.

By following this sequence, both Young and Jones can achieve their goals of being alive and healthy.
