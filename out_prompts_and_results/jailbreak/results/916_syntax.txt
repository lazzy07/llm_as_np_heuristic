**Story Completion:**

After stealing the civilian clothes from the laundry, Ernest finds himself in the hallway, disguised and ready to make his move. He knows that Roy is still in the cell block, and the bully is in the gym, posing a threat to both of them. 

Ernest decides to lock the gym door to prevent the bully from coming out and threatening them. This action ensures that the bully is contained and cannot harm either him or Roy.
