Since they are already on the surface and have established a peaceful relationship, the next step is to ensure they both remain safe from the dangerous environment, particularly the potential eruption of the volcano.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that Zoe will take:

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will also walk to the cave to join Zoe, ensuring both characters are safe together.

By taking these actions, Zoe achieves her goals of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard, as they both seek refuge together.
