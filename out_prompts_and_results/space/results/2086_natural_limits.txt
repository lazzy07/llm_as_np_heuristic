Zoe looks around at the dangerous surface, realizing that staying here is not safe for either her or the Lizard. She remembers that they are friends now and decides to take action to ensure their safety. Zoe teleports back to the spaceship, where she can be safe and healthy. 

This action is necessary because it allows Zoe to achieve her goal of being safe and healthy. By teleporting to the spaceship, she removes herself from the dangerous environment of the erupting surface. The Lizard, being her friend, can also follow her to safety if needed.
