2. **Assessing Ross**: Similarly, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A to identify his symptoms. This is crucial for ensuring that Ross receives the appropriate treatment.

3. **Admitting Young**: Young is currently in Admissions and needs to be assigned to an exam room. Admitting him to Patient Room B allows Dr. Hathaway to assess and treat him.

4. **Assessing Young**: After admitting Young, Dr. Hathaway assesses him to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to provide the correct treatment.

5. **Treating Jones for Flaze**: Based on the assessment, if Jones is determined to have a fever (symptom of Flaze), Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze.

6. **Treating Ross for Flaze**: If Ross is also determined to have a fever, Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics as well, ensuring he becomes healthy.

7. **Treating Young for Jarkis**: If Young is found to have a rash (symptom of Jarkis), Dr. Hathaway treats him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis.

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats all patients, achieving the goal of ensuring they are all healthy.
