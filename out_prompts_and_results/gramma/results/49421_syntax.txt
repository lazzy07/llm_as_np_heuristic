To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **loot(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will loot the coin from Tom, as Tom is currently carrying the coin and is unarmed. This action allows the Bandit to increase her coin count.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will then take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp, ensuring she has as many coins as possible.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal by first robbing Tom of his coin and then taking the coins from the chest at her camp.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Looting Tom's Coin**: The Bandit is armed and can rob Tom, who is unarmed. This action is necessary for the Bandit to increase her coin count.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This action allows the Bandit to maximize her coin collection, fulfilling her goal of having as many coins as possible.
