Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A. Since Young is the only patient in the room, Dr. Hathaway can focus on their symptoms. With a workload of 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but since Young is the only patient being assessed, Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies that Young is experiencing a fever, which indicates Flaze. Dr. Hathaway then treats Young with antibiotics, successfully curing them.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Ross to an exam room. Since Ross is also experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway can assign Ross to Patient Room B. This action does not increase the workload since Dr. Hathaway has already treated Young.

By treating Young successfully, Dr. Hathaway achieves their goal of ensuring that at least one patient is healthy.
