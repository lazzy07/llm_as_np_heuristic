Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Ross is experiencing Unknown symptoms, Hathaway cannot accurately diagnose him. However, Hathaway decides to treat Ross with antibiotics, mistakenly believing he has Flaze due to his workload being at 2. This treatment fails, and Ross dies.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Jones, who is experiencing Fever. Hathaway correctly diagnoses Jones with Flaze and treats him with antibiotics, successfully making him healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions again to admit Young to Patient Room B. Young is experiencing Rash, and Hathaway will treat him with steroids in the next step, ensuring he becomes healthy as well.

In this way, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Jones and prepares to treat Young, achieving the goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
