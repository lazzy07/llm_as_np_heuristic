To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Cottage, Crossroads)**: The bandit starts at the cottage and walks to the crossroads to be in a position to interact with other characters.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The bandit then walks to the market, where she can potentially find Tom and the merchant.

3. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The bandit, armed with a sword, robs Tom, who is not armed, and takes the coins that Tom is carrying. This action directly helps the bandit achieve her goal of carrying more coins.

4. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit walks back to the crossroads to position herself for the next move.

5. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: Finally, the bandit walks to the bandit camp, where she can store the coins in the chest, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

This sequence of actions ensures that the bandit successfully increases her coin count and achieves her goal without any unnecessary actions.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The bandit starts at the cottage to begin her journey.
- Moving to the crossroads and then to the market allows her to encounter Tom, who has coins.
- Robbing Tom is a strategic move to gain coins without engaging in a fight, as Tom is unarmed.
- Returning to the crossroads and then heading to the camp allows her to secure her coins in a safe location.
