To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R11, R22)**: Blake moves from the living room (R11) to the dining room (R22) where Alex and Casey are located. This is necessary for Blake to interact with them and potentially trade or give items.

2. **tell(C2, C3, I2, R22)**: Blake tells Casey that they want the chocolates (I2). This is a lie, as Blake actually wants the jewelry (I2). However, this action is necessary to manipulate the situation to get the jewelry.

3. **give(C3, I3, C2, R22)**: Casey, believing Blake's lie, gives Blake the flowers (I3) in exchange for the chocolates (I2). This action is necessary for Blake to receive an item from Casey.

4. **trade(C2, I3, C1, I2, R22)**: Blake trades the flowers (I3) they just received from Casey with Alex for the jewelry (I2). This is the key action that allows Blake to finally get the item they want.

5. **move(C2, R22, R11)**: Blake moves back to the living room (R11) to be in a space where they can enjoy their happiness with the jewelry.

After these actions, Blake will be happy because they have the jewelry, which is what they wanted.
