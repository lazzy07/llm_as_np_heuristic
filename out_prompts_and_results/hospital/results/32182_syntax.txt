To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know if Young has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) to provide the correct treatment.
