To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake ends up with the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the jewelry is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the jewelry to pick it up.

2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the jewelry. This is essential for Casey to have the item that Blake wants.

3. **move(C2, R21, R12)**: Casey moves back to the living room where Blake is located. This allows Casey to be in the same room as Blake to give them the jewelry.

4. **give(C2, I2, C3, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry to Blake. This action ensures that Blake receives the item they want, making Blake happy.

5. **put_down(C3, I1, R12)**: Blake puts down the chocolates they were holding. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving Blake's happiness but helps to clarify the situation and allows for a clean transition.

6. **trade(C3, I1, C1, I3, R12)**: Blake trades the chocolates for the flowers with Alex. This action is included to ensure that Alex also has an item they want, which is the flowers, making them happy as well.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey needs to be in the dining room to pick up the jewelry.
- **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the jewelry, which is what Blake wants.
- **move(C2, R21, R12)**: Casey returns to the living room to give the jewelry to Blake.
- **give(C2, I2, C3, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry to Blake, making Blake happy.
- **put_down(C3, I1, R12)**: Blake puts down the chocolates, clarifying the situation.
- **trade(C3, I1, C1, I3, R12)**: Blake trades chocolates for flowers with Alex, ensuring Alex is also happy.
