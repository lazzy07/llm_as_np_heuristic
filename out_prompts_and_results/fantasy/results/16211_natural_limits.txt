In the cave, Gargax, feeling increasingly hungry, decides to eat Rory, who is at the cave with Talia. This action is crucial because it eliminates one of the humans, allowing Talia to take the treasure Rory had picked up earlier. After Gargax eats Rory, Talia can then pick up the treasure, which will make her wealthy.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. Gargax eats Rory. (This action reduces the number of humans, allowing Talia to access the treasure without competition.)
2. Talia picks up the treasure. (This action makes Talia wealthy, fulfilling her goal.)

With these two actions, Talia becomes wealthy, which directly contributes to her happiness.
