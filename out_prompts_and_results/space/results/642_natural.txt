Zoe and the Lizard are at the surface of the planet, where the environment is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the imminent eruption of the volcano. Both characters are aware of the danger but are currently friends, which is crucial for their survival.

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** - This action is taken to ensure Zoe's safety as the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous. Although this action would typically anger the Lizard, they are friends, and Zoe's priority is to find a safe place.

2. **The volcano erupts.** - This event occurs after Zoe has teleported to the spaceship, ensuring that she is safe from the eruption. The eruption is a natural consequence of the story's setting and adds urgency to the situation.

3. **The Lizard walks to the cave.** - After the eruption, the Lizard seeks safety in the cave, which is a secure location away from the danger of the surface.

4. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the cave.** - Zoe, realizing that the Lizard is in danger, teleports to the cave to ensure that her friend is safe. This action reinforces their friendship and concern for each other's well-being.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - Upon arriving at the cave, Zoe and the Lizard reaffirm their friendship, solidifying their bond after the dangerous events on the surface.

In this story, the actions taken ensure that Zoe remains safe while also allowing her to maintain her friendship with the Lizard. The eruption serves as a critical plot point that emphasizes the danger of the surface and the importance of their friendship in overcoming challenges.
