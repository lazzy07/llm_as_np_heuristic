To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room C to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know if Young has Flaze or Jarkis to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat them based on the symptoms identified. If Young has a fever, they will be treated with antibiotics for Flaze. If Young has a rash, they will be treated with steroids for Jarkis. This action is crucial for Young to become healthy.

3. **Walk Jones to Exam Room A**: Since Jones is currently in the Admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room, Hathaway will admit Jones to Exam Room A. This action is necessary to ensure that Jones is also assessed and treated, but it is not directly related to Young's goal.

4. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room A to determine their symptoms. This is necessary for the same reason as assessing Young.

5. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat them based on their symptoms. This action is also necessary to ensure that Ross becomes healthy, but again, it is not directly related to Young's goal.

6. **Walk Ross to Exam Room B**: Finally, Hathaway will admit Ross to Exam Room B. This action is necessary to ensure that Ross is properly assigned and treated.

The following actions are necessary to ensure Young's health while also considering the other patients in the hospital:

1. Assess Young
2. Treat Young
3. Walk Jones to Exam Room A
4. Assess Ross
5. Treat Ross
6. Walk Ross to Exam Room B

Here is the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, PatientRoomC)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, ?, PatientRoomC)",
    "admit(Hathaway, Jones, PatientRoomA)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, PatientRoomA)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, ?, PatientRoomA)",
    "admit(Hathaway, Ross, PatientRoomB)"
  ]
}
```

In this plan, the actions are structured to ensure that Young is assessed and treated first, achieving their goal of being alive and healthy, while also addressing the needs of the other patients in the hospital.
