In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) that is currently with Casey (C3). To achieve their goal of being happy, Alex needs to get the jewelry from Casey. 

Hereâ€™s the shortest story to achieve this:

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the flowers (I3) and may or may not be happy depending on their own desires, but Alex's goal is achieved.

### Explanation of the action:
