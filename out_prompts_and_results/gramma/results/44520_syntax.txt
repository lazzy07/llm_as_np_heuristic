To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant, taking the BanditCoin. This action is necessary because the Bandit needs to increase her coin count, and the Merchant is currently armed but not a threat since she is already attacked and incapacitated.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will then walk to the Bandit Camp and place the BanditCoin in the chest. This action is essential for securing the coins in a safe location, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

The Bandit successfully robs the Merchant and secures the coins in her camp, achieving her goal.
