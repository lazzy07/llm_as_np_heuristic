To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake gets the item they want. In this case, Blake wants the jewelry (I2). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **tell(C2, C3, I2, R12)**: Blake (C2) tells Casey (C3) that Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I2). This is a lie, as Alex actually wants the chocolates (I1). However, this action is necessary to create a misunderstanding that will lead to the next steps.

2. **move(C3, R12, R21)**: Casey (C3) moves to the dining room (R21) to check for the jewelry (I2) since they believe Alex wants it.

3. **pick_up(C3, I2, R21)**: Casey (C3) picks up the jewelry (I2) from the dining room (R21).

4. **move(C3, R21, R12)**: Casey (C3) moves back to the living room (R12) to give the jewelry (I2) to Blake (C2).

5. **give(C3, I2, C2, R12)**: Casey (C3) gives the jewelry (I2) to Blake (C2). Now, Blake has the item they want, making them happy.
