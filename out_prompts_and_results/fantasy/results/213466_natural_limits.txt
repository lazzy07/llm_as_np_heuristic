In this story, Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. To achieve this, Rory needs to acquire the treasure located in the cave, as it will make him wealthy. Since Talia is already married to Rory, he is happy. 

Hereâ€™s the shortest story where Rory achieves his goal:

1. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.** - Rory needs to leave the cave to reach Talia and Vince, who are at the village. This action is necessary for Rory to interact with Vince and potentially acquire the money or treasure.

2. **Rory proposes to Vince.** - Since Rory is already married to Talia, he can propose to Vince to create a bond that may lead to sharing wealth. This action is necessary for Rory to ensure that he can access Vince's money.

3. **Vince accepts Rory's proposal.** - Vince accepts Rory's proposal, which makes both characters happy. This action is necessary for Rory to feel fulfilled in his relationships.

4. **Rory takes the money from Vince.** - Rory takes the money from Vince, which increases his wealth. This action is necessary for Rory to achieve his goal of being wealthy.

5. **Rory travels from the village to the cave.** - Rory returns to the cave to retrieve the treasure, which is essential for him to become fully wealthy.

6. **Rory picks up the treasure in the cave.** - Rory picks up the treasure, completing his goal of becoming wealthy.

Now, Rory is happy (due to his marriage to Talia), wealthy (after taking the money and picking up the treasure), and not hungry (as he has not become hungry throughout the story).
