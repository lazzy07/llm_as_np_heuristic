To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.** - Rory needs to return to the village to interact with Talia and Vince, who are both there. This is essential for Rory to achieve his goals.

2. **Rory proposes to Talia.** - Since Talia is already married to Rory, this action is redundant but serves to reinforce their relationship. However, it is not necessary for Rory's goal.

3. **Talia accepts Rory's proposal.** - This action is also redundant since they are already married, but it reinforces their bond.

4. **Rory takes the money from Vince.** - This is crucial for Rory to become wealthy. Since Vince has the money, Rory needs to take it to fulfill his goal.

5. **Rory becomes hungry.** - This action is necessary for Rory to experience hunger, which is a part of his goal to not be hungry.

6. **Gargax eats Rory.** - This action is necessary for Rory to be removed from the story, but it also leads to a situation where Rory's goals are ultimately not achieved in a traditional sense. However, it can be interpreted that Rory's happiness is fulfilled through his relationships, even if he is no longer alive.

The story concludes with Rory achieving his goal of being happy (through marriage) and wealthy (by taking the money), but he does not achieve the goal of not being hungry due to Gargax's action.

Here is the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Rory travels from the cave to the village.",
    "Rory proposes to Talia.",
    "Talia accepts Rory's proposal.",
    "Rory takes the money from Vince.",
    "Rory becomes hungry.",
    "Gargax eats Rory."
  ]
}
``` 

This plan outlines the necessary actions taken to achieve Rory's goals, even if the final outcome is unconventional.
