**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C and confirms that he has a fever, indicating that he has Flaze. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but she correctly identifies the disease. She then treats Jones with antibiotics, successfully curing him.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to assess Ross, who is still there. She admits Ross to Patient Room B and assesses him. Since Ross's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway cannot determine if he has Flaze or Jarkis. However, she decides to treat him with steroids, assuming he might have Jarkis. Unfortunately, this is a mistake, and Ross dies.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to the admissions room to admit Young to Patient Room A. She assesses Young and finds that he has a rash, indicating Jarkis. This time, Hathaway treats Young with steroids, successfully curing him.

In the end, Jones and Young are healthy, while Ross has died. Despite the loss, Dr. Hathaway has achieved her goal of ensuring that at least some patients are healthy.
