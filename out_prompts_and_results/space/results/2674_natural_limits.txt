Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to teleport back to her spaceship for safety. However, this action angers the Lizard, who perceives Zoe's teleportation as a threat to the planet he guards. The Lizard, feeling protective, teleports to the surface to confront Zoe. 

Upon arrival, the Lizard sees Zoe's fear and the imminent eruption of the volcano. Instead of fighting, the Lizard chooses to communicate with Zoe, explaining that he is the guardian of the surface and that they both want to be safe and healthy. Zoe, understanding the Lizard's intentions, agrees to make peace. 

As they talk, the volcano erupts, causing chaos. In the confusion, Zoe is injured but survives, while the Lizard, in a heroic act to save Zoe, pushes her out of harm's way but is caught in the eruption himself.
