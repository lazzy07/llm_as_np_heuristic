To achieve the goal of Talia becoming happy or wealthy, we can focus on the relationships and the items available in the cave. The key actions will involve Talia accepting a marriage proposal from Rory, which will make her happy, and then Talia can also take the treasure, which will make her wealthy.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **accept(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: Talia accepts Rory's marriage proposal. This action makes Talia happy, as it fulfills her desire for happiness.
2. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action increases her wealth.

Now, Talia is both happy and wealthy, fulfilling her goals.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **accept(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: This action is necessary because Talia's happiness is contingent on accepting Rory's proposal. By accepting, she achieves her goal of happiness.
- **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: This action is necessary for Talia to become wealthy. Since the treasure is in the cave, and Talia is already there, she can pick it up to increase her wealth.
