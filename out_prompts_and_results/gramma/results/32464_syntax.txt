To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **loot(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will loot the coin from Tom, who is currently alive and has a coin. This action is necessary for the Bandit to increase her coin count.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will then take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has coins secured in her camp, fulfilling her goal.

The Bandit successfully robs Tom and then retrieves the coins from her camp, achieving her goal of having coins.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Looting Tom**: This action is essential because it allows the Bandit to gain a coin directly from Tom, increasing her wealth and bringing her closer to her goal.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This action is necessary to ensure that the Bandit has coins stored in her camp, which is another way to achieve her goal.
