To complete the story, we need to ensure that Hathaway, the doctor, successfully treats all patients (Jones, Ross, and Young) and makes them healthy. Given the current situation, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Hathaway needs to determine Young's symptoms to decide on the appropriate treatment. This is crucial because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Young in Exam Room B with the appropriate treatment**: Once Hathaway assesses Young and identifies the symptoms, they will treat Young accordingly. If Young has a fever, they will receive antibiotics for Flaze; if Young has a rash, they will receive steroids for Jarkis. This action is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

3. **Admit Jones to Exam Room A**: After treating Young, Hathaway will admit Jones to an exam room to assess and treat him as well. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are treated.

4. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms, which is essential for providing the correct treatment.

5. **Treat Jones in Exam Room A with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the correct medication, ensuring he becomes healthy.

6. **Admit Ross to Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway will admit Ross to an exam room to assess and treat him.

7. **Assess Ross in Exam Room C**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms.

8. **Treat Ross in Exam Room C with the appropriate treatment**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the correct medication, ensuring he becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients, achieving their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
