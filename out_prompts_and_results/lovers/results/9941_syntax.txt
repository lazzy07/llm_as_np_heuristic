To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R12) where Casey is located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to interact with them.

2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

3. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R12) to be with Alex and Casey. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps maintain the social dynamic and ensures that Blake is also involved in the resolution.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)**: This action directly gives Alex the item they want, making them happy.
- **move(C3, R22, R12)**: While this does not affect Alex's happiness directly, it keeps Blake engaged in the story and allows for a potential future interaction.
