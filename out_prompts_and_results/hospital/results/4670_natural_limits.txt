Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to reach the patients who are currently in the admissions room (Jones, Ross, and Young) so that she can assess their symptoms.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C.**  
   - By admitting Ross to an exam room, Dr. Hathaway can then assess him for any symptoms he may have. This action also increases her workload to 3, but she will still be able to assess and treat the patients without making a mistake yet.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to determine Young's symptoms. Since Young is in Patient Room B, she can assess him without any confusion.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.**  
   - Assuming Young has the rash symptom of Jarkis, Dr. Hathaway treats him with steroids, which will make him healthy. This action reduces her workload back to 2.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.**  
   - Assuming Ross has a fever symptom of Flaze, Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, which will also make him healthy. This action reduces her workload back to 1.

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats both Young and Ross, ensuring that all patients are healthy.
