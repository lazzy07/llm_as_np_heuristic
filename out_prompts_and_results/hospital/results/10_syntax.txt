In this story, we will focus on the actions of Dr. Hathaway as she assesses and treats the patients. The goal is to ensure that at least one patient becomes healthy or dies based on the symptoms and treatments available.

1. **Admit Jones to Exam Room A**: Dr. Hathaway will admit Jones to Exam Room A. This action is necessary because Jones is currently in the admissions room and needs to be assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment. This increases Hathaway's workload to 1.

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Dr. Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room A. Since Young is already in Exam Room A, this action is valid. Dr. Hathaway will discover that Young has SymptomB, which corresponds to Jarkis.

3. **Treat Young with Steroids**: Dr. Hathaway will treat Young with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis. This action will make Young healthy, as the treatment matches the symptoms.

4. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Dr. Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room A. Since Jones has SymptomA, which is not yet known to Hathaway, she will mistakenly believe he has Jarkis due to her workload being 1 and not making a mistake.

5. **Treat Jones with Steroids**: Dr. Hathaway will treat Jones with steroids, which is incorrect since he actually has Flaze. This will result in Jones dying because the treatment does not match his symptoms.

The story ends with Young becoming healthy and Jones dying, fulfilling the requirement of at least one patient becoming healthy or dying.
