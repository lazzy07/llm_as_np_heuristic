To ensure Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomA to confirm his symptoms. Since Ross has already been assigned to this room, Hathaway can check for the specific disease he has.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has SymptomB, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment. Since we know that SymptomB corresponds to Jarkis, Hathaway will administer steroids.

3. **Walk Jones to Exam Room C**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will admit Jones to Exam Room C. This action is necessary to ensure that Jones is also assessed and treated, but it is not directly related to Ross's immediate goal.

4. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are healthy, aligning with Hathaway's goal.

5. **Treat Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Jones based on the symptoms identified. If Jones has a fever, he will be treated with antibiotics for Flaze.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: This confirms Ross's condition and allows Hathaway to determine the correct treatment.
2. **Treat Ross**: This action directly leads to Ross becoming healthy.
3. **Walk Jones to Exam Room C**: This prepares for Jones's assessment and treatment.
4. **Assess Jones**: This is necessary to identify Jones's condition.
5. **Treat Jones**: This ensures that Jones is also healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomB, PatientRoomA)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, PatientRoomA)",
    "walk(Jones, Admissions, PatientRoomC)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom(Jones), PatientRoomC)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomC)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Ross achieves his goal of being alive and healthy while also addressing the health of Jones.
