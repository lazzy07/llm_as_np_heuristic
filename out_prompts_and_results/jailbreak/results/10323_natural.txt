**Story Completion:**

Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, decides to take a risk. He knows that the bully is in the gym and believes that Roy is still in the kitchen. To ensure his safety and to help Roy, he locks the gym door from the hallway, trapping the bully inside. This action prevents the bully from threatening either of them for the time being.

Next, Ernest crawls through the vents to reach the highway. He knows that once he is outside, he can escape the prison and be free from the bully's threats.
