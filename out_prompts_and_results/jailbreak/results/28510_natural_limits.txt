Ernest, realizing the threat posed by the bully, decides to take decisive action. He knows he has the knife and the locked gym door gives him a moment of safety. He turns to Roy and says, "We need to get rid of him now." With a swift motion, Ernest lunges at the bully, using the knife to kill him. The bully, caught off guard, falls to the ground, no longer a threat to either of them.

With the bully out of the way, Ernest and Roy can now focus on their escape. Ernest quickly puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier, disguising himself. He then unlocks the gym door, and both he and Roy make their way to the hallway. From there, they crawl through the vents to the highway outside the prison. Once on the highway, they both put on their civilian clothes, ensuring they look like ordinary citizens. Finally, they escape from the prison, achieving their goal of staying alive and free.
