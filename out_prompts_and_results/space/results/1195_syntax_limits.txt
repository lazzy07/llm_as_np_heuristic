In this story, Zoe, the space explorer, is currently safe aboard her spaceship while the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, is on the dangerous surface. The relationship between Zoe and the Lizard is friendly, but the Lizard is not safe due to the erupting volcano. 

To achieve the goal of having the volcano erupt and a character die, while also ensuring that Zoe and the Lizard become friends, the following actions will take place:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)** - This action has already been executed, indicating that the volcano is about to erupt.
2. **erupt(Surface)** - This action will cause the volcano to erupt, leading to the death of the Lizard, who is on the surface and thus unable to escape the eruption.
3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)** - This action will occur after the eruption, as Zoe will reflect on her relationship with the Lizard and realize that despite the unfortunate outcome, they had formed a bond.

The story will be completed with the eruption of the volcano, resulting in the Lizard's death, and the acknowledgment of their friendship.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "erupt(Surface)",
    "make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Actions:
- **erupt(Surface)**: This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of the volcano erupting and causing a character to die. Since the Lizard is on the surface, it will not survive the eruption.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action signifies the friendship that was formed between Zoe and the Lizard, even in the face of tragedy. It reflects Zoe's understanding of their bond, despite the Lizard's demise. 

This sequence of actions ensures that the story meets the specified ending conditions while remaining concise.
