To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want to interact with it.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the flowers (I1) from the living room (R22). This is essential as Alex needs to have the flowers to be happy.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) to be in the same room as Casey, who is currently in the dining room (R12).

4. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) to be closer to Alex. This is necessary for the next action.

5. **give(C1, I1, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the flowers (I1) to Casey. This is crucial because it allows Alex to fulfill their desire to make Casey happy, which in turn makes Alex happy.

6. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey moves to the living room (R22) to be with Alex after receiving the flowers.

At this point, Alex is happy because they have given the flowers to Casey, who is also happy because they received the item they wanted. 

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:
