To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to navigate the current situation strategically. Hereâ€™s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **Tom walks from Market to Crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to leave the market where he currently is and move towards the crossroads, which is the only path leading to the cottage.

2. **Tom walks from Crossroads to Cottage.**  
   - This action allows Tom to reach his desired location, the cottage, where he wants to be carrying the medicine.

At this point, Tom is at the cottage with the medicine, achieving his goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Walking from Market to Crossroads:** This is the first step for Tom to leave the market, where he is surrounded by the merchant and the guard, and head towards the crossroads, which is a necessary junction to reach the cottage.
- **Walking from Crossroads to Cottage:** This final step takes Tom directly to his goal location, the cottage, where he can be with the medicine he has purchased.

### JSON Object with Final Plan:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)",
    "walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Tom successfully reaches the cottage with the medicine in the shortest possible sequence of actions.
