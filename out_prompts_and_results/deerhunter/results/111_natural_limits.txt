Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, decides to take action to achieve his goal of obtaining money. He knows that Bambi is nearby in the forest and sees an opportunity. 

1. **Bubba loads the ammunition into the rifle.** (This action is necessary because Bubba needs a loaded gun to intimidate or threaten Bambi.)
2. **Bubba shoots Bambi.** (Bubba wants to eat, and since Bambi is a deer, he can eat her if she is dead. This action also aligns with Bubba's goal of obtaining money, as he may sell the deer for cash.)
3. **Bubba eats Bambi.** (This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and allows him to gain sustenance.)
4. **Bubba decides to get money.** (After eating, Bubba's next goal is to acquire money, which he can do by selling the deer or using it for trade.)
5. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** (This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the bank where he can potentially sell the deer or trade it for money.)

By following these actions, Bubba successfully achieves his goal of obtaining money.
