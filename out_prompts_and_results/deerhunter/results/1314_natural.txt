To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the bank where the clerk is located, as he needs to confront the clerk to get the money.

2. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can threaten the clerk to steal the money. This action aligns with Bubba's goal of obtaining money.

3. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - This action directly fulfills Bubba's desire to have money, as he successfully takes the clerk's money.

At this point, Bubba has achieved his goal of having money, and Bambi is already dead. 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Going to the bank**: This is essential for Bubba to interact with the clerk and attempt to obtain the money.
- **Deciding to steal**: This action is a strategic choice that allows Bubba to use his advantage (the rifle) to intimidate the clerk.
- **Stealing the money**: This is the final action that fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring money.
