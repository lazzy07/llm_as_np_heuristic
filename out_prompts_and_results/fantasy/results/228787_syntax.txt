To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory is currently in the Village. To achieve his goal, he needs to be in the Cave where the treasure is located. This action allows him to move to the Cave.

2. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Once in the Cave, Rory can pick up the treasure. This action is essential for Rory to increase his wealth, which is one of his goals.

3. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: After picking up the treasure, Rory will travel back to the Village. This is necessary because he needs to be in the Village to interact with Talia and Vince.

4. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory can marry Talia, who has already accepted his proposal. This action will make both Rory and Talia happy, fulfilling Rory's goal of happiness.

5. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory can become hungry, which is a natural consequence of his actions. However, this does not affect his overall goal since he has already achieved happiness and wealth.

6. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax, who is in the Cave, can eat Rory. This action is included to show the consequences of Rory's choices, but it does not affect his previously achieved goals of happiness and wealth.

In summary, the actions taken ensure that Rory achieves his goals of happiness and wealth through marriage and acquiring treasure, even though he becomes hungry and is eaten by Gargax afterward.
