To ensure Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomA to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know if Ross has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Ross to become healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will also assess Young in PatientRoomA to determine his symptoms. This is important because Young is also a patient and needs to be treated if he is unwell.

4. **Treat Young**: Depending on Young's symptoms, Hathaway will treat him accordingly. This ensures that all patients are taken care of, which aligns with Hathaway's goal of having all patients healthy.

5. **Walk Jones to Exam Room A**: Finally, Jones will walk to PatientRoomA to be assessed by Hathaway. This is necessary to ensure that Jones is also healthy, as he is currently in the admissions room.

Hereâ€™s the complete sequence of actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms.
2. **Treat Ross**: Hathaway treats Ross based on the assessment.
3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine his symptoms.
4. **Treat Young**: Hathaway treats Young based on the assessment.
5. **Walk Jones to Exam Room A**: Jones walks to PatientRoomA to be assessed.
