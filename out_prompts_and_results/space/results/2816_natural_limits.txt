As the Lizard arrives, the ground shakes violently, and the volcano begins to erupt. Zoe, now back on the surface, sees the Lizard and understands that they both want to be safe and healthy. Instead of fighting, Zoe extends a hand of friendship, expressing her desire to work together to escape the impending eruption. The Lizard, recognizing Zoe's genuine intentions, agrees to make peace.
