Bubba is currently at the forest, having just shot Bambi. He is hungry and wants to have money. Since he already has 1 money, he needs to ensure he can keep it and not lose it to the bank clerk. The clerk is at the bank and has 0 money, but he believes that Bambi is alive, which could lead to complications if he finds out about Bambi's fate.

To achieve his goal of having money, Bubba will take the following actions:

1. **Bubba decides to eat**: Since Bubba is hungry and has just killed Bambi, he will eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary for Bubba to maintain his health and energy, which is crucial for his survival and ability to keep his money.

2. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank**: After eating, Bubba will go to the bank. This action is necessary for him to confront the clerk and ensure that he can keep his money without any threats.

3. **Bubba decides to get money**: Once at the bank, Bubba will decide to get money. This action is necessary for him to assert his claim to the money he already has and to ensure that he can keep it without any interference from the clerk.

4. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk at gunpoint**: Since Bubba has the rifle loaded with ammunition, he can threaten the clerk to give him the money. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of having more money.

After these actions, Bubba will have successfully achieved his goal of having money.
