To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to have him walk back to the cottage after acquiring the medicine from the merchant. Since Tom has already robbed the medicine from the merchant, he can now proceed to the cottage without any further conflict. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom walks from the Crossroads to the Cottage, which is his desired location. This action is necessary for Tom to achieve his goal of being at the cottage.

This is the only action needed to complete the story, as Tom already has the medicine after robbing it from the merchant.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action allows Tom to reach his goal location (the cottage) while carrying the medicine he has already obtained. There are no conflicts or additional actions required since he is not being pursued by the guard or the bandit at this point.
