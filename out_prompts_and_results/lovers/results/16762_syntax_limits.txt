In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy, and they are in the dining room (R22) with Blake (C2), who has put down the chocolates (I3) in the same room. Casey (C3) is in the bathroom (R12) and is not happy either. 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the simplest action is for Blake to give the jewelry (I1) to Alex. Since Blake is in the same room as Alex, this action can be performed directly.

**Action:**
1. **give(Blake, I1, Alex, R22)** - Blake gives the jewelry to Alex in the dining room.

This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making them happy. Since Alex's happiness is the goal, this single action is sufficient to complete the story.

**Final Plan:**
```json
{
  "plan": ["give(Blake, I1, Alex, R22)"]
}
```
