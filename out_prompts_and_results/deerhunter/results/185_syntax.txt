To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the bank with a loaded rifle and has already stolen the rifle from the clerk. He is hungry and has a greed level of 1, indicating he wants more money. The clerk has no money, and Bambi is alive in the forest, which is not directly relevant to Bubba's goal.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will shoot the clerk to eliminate him as a threat and to take the money from the bank. This action is necessary because the clerk is the only other character in the bank, and Bubba needs to ensure he can access the money without opposition.

2. **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can eat the clerk. This action is included because Bubba is hungry, and it allows him to satisfy his hunger while also ensuring that he has no witnesses to his actions.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Finally, Bubba will decide to take the money from the bank. This action is necessary to fulfill his greed and achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Eliminates the clerk, allowing Bubba to take the money without any opposition.
- **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger by consuming the clerk.
- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Ensures Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money.
