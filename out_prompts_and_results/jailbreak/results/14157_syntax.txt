**Story Completion:**

After completing their chores in the laundry, Ernest is aware that Roy is in a precarious situation on the highway, disguised in civilian clothes. He knows that the bully is a threat and that he needs to help Roy escape. 

1. **Go to Hallway (Ernest)**: Ernest decides to leave the laundry room and move to the hallway to find a way to assist Roy. This action is necessary for him to reach a location where he can interact with Roy.

2. **Vent (Ernest, Hallway)**: Once in the hallway, Ernest crawls through the vents to reach the gym. This action is crucial as it allows him to bypass the bully and potentially lock him in the gym.

3. **Lock Gym (Ernest, Hallway)**: After reaching the gym, Ernest locks the door to prevent the bully from escaping. This action is essential to ensure that the bully cannot threaten either him or Roy while they plan their next move.

4. **Next Day (Day 2)**: The story transitions to day two, allowing for new opportunities and actions to unfold.

5. **Go to Hallway (Roy)**: Meanwhile, Roy, still disguised, decides to move from the highway back to the hallway to regroup with Ernest. This action is necessary for them to coordinate their escape.

6. **Escape (Roy, Highway)**: With the bully locked in the gym and the guards unaware, Roy takes the opportunity to escape through the highway. This action is the culmination of their efforts, allowing Roy to achieve his goal of being alive and free.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Ernest's actions are focused on ensuring both he and Roy are safe from the bully. By moving to the hallway and locking the gym, he effectively neutralizes the threat.
- Roy's actions are aimed at reuniting with Ernest and then escaping. His disguise allows him to leave the prison without being detected.
