To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Ross is in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room yet, Hathaway should admit Ross to an exam room and then assess him to determine his symptoms.
2. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: This action will allow Hathaway to assess Ross's condition.
3. **Assess Ross**: After admitting Ross to Exam Room B, Hathaway can assess him to see what symptoms he is showing.
4. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment for his symptoms.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: This increases Hathaway's workload to 2 but allows Ross to be assessed.
2. **Assess Ross**: This will reveal Ross's symptoms, allowing Hathaway to determine the correct treatment.
3. **Treat Ross**: Depending on the symptoms revealed during the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross appropriately, ensuring he becomes healthy.

Now, let's assume Ross has the symptom of a rash (indicating Jarkis), and Hathaway treats him with steroids, which is the correct treatment.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Admit(Ross, Exam Room B)**: This is necessary to move Ross from the admissions room to an exam room where he can be assessed.
- **Assess(Ross)**: This is crucial to identify Ross's symptoms, which will guide the treatment.
- **Treat(Ross)**: This is the final step to ensure Ross receives the correct treatment based on his symptoms, leading to his recovery.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:

{
  "plan": [
    "admit(Hathaway, Ross, PatientRoomB)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomB, PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, PatientRoomB)"

```

This plan ensures that Hathaway successfully treats Ross, contributing to the overall goal of making all patients healthy.
