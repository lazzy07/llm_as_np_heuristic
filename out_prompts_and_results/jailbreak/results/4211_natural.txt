**Story Completion:**

As the first day progresses, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, realizes that he needs to escape the prison before the bully can act on his threats. He knows that the bully is currently locked in the gym, which gives him a moment of safety. 

1. **Roy crawls through the vents to the highway.** This action allows Roy to bypass the bully and the guards, moving towards his escape route without being detected.

2. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes on the highway.** Although he is already disguised, this action reinforces his disguise and prepares him for the final step of his escape.

3. **Roy escapes from the prison.** With the disguise on and being on the highway, Roy successfully leaves the prison, achieving his goal of being alive and free.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Crawling through the vents to the highway is essential for Roy to avoid confrontation with the bully and guards, ensuring his safety.
- Putting on the civilian clothes is a precautionary measure to solidify his disguise, making it less likely for anyone to recognize him as a prisoner.
- Escaping from the prison is the ultimate goal, allowing Roy to achieve his desire to be alive and free from threats.
