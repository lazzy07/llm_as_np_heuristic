To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This action is necessary because Blake needs to be in a position to trade items with Alex.

2. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey also moves to the dining room (R21). This action is necessary for Casey to be able to trade items with Blake.

3. **trade(C2, I3, C3, I2, R21)**: Casey trades the flowers (I3) they have for the chocolates (I2) that Blake has. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain an item they want, which is the chocolates.

4. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Alex.

5. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to have an item that they want, which is the jewelry (I1).

6. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Alex and Casey.

7. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Alex's desire to have the jewelry, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry they wanted, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:

- Finally, Blake gives the jewelry to Alex, fulfilling Alex's desire and making them happy.
