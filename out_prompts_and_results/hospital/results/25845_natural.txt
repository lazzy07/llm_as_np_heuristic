**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their symptoms, decides to first assess Jones in Patient Room B. 

1. **Assess Jones in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes that Jones has Jarkis (the rash disease) instead of Flaze (the fever disease). 

2. **Treat Jones in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, the treatment for Jarkis. Since she misdiagnosed him, this treatment is incorrect, and unfortunately, Jones dies.

Next, Dr. Hathaway needs to reduce her workload and assess the remaining patients.

3. **Walk from Patient Room B to Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room A to assess Ross.

4. **Assess Ross in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also experiencing an unknown symptom. Again, due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes that Ross has Jarkis.

5. **Treat Ross in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, the treatment for Jarkis. This treatment is also incorrect, and Ross dies.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway must assess Young to ensure he receives the correct treatment.

6. **Walk from Patient Room A to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Young.

7. **Admit Young to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C, where he is already assigned.

8. **Assess Young in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to her workload being reduced to 1, she correctly identifies that Young has Flaze.

9. **Treat Young in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. Young becomes healthy.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway achieves her goal of ensuring that at least one patient is healthy, despite the unfortunate outcomes for Jones and Ross.
