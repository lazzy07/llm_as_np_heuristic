To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax travels from the village to the cave.**  
   - Gargax wants to be wealthy and not hungry. By traveling to the cave, Gargax can access the treasure, which aligns with his goals.

2. **Gargax takes the treasure from the cave.**  
   - Gargax takes the treasure to fulfill his desire for wealth.

3. **Gargax travels back to the village.**  
   - Gargax returns to the village with the treasure, which may lead to a confrontation with Rory.

4. **Gargax eats Rory.**  
   - Gargax, being at the village with Rory, will eat him. This action is necessary for Gargax to satisfy his hunger and ensure he has wealth (the treasure).

5. **Rory takes the money from Gargax's dead body.**  
   - After Gargax eats Rory, Rory is considered dead. Rory can now take the money from Gargax's body, which fulfills his goal of being wealthy.

6. **Rory becomes happy.**  
   - With the money taken from Gargax, Rory achieves happiness as he has wealth.

This sequence of actions ensures that Rory achieves his goals of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, despite the unfortunate events that transpired.
