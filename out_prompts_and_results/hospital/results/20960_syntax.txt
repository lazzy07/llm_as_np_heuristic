To complete the story, we need to ensure that Hathaway, the doctor, assesses and treats both patients, Jones and Young, correctly to achieve the goal of having all patients healthy. Since Jones is already in Exam Room A, we will assess and treat him first. Then, we will have Hathaway walk to Exam Room B to assess and treat Young. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether he has Flaze or Jarkis.
2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway treats Jones with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial for Jones to become healthy.
3. **Walk to Exam Room B**: Hathaway walks to Exam Room B to assess Young. This is necessary to ensure that Young is also treated.
4. **Assess Young**: Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether he has Flaze or Jarkis.
5. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway treats Young with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial for Young to become healthy.

By following this sequence, Hathaway will successfully treat both patients, ensuring they are healthy.
