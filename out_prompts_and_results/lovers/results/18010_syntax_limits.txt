In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the flowers (I1) to be happy, but they are currently in the same room as Blake (C2) and Casey (C3), who is already happy with the jewelry (I3). Since Alex believes that Casey has the jewelry and wants to make Blake happy, they need to take action to get the flowers.

**Action:**
1. **trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R22)** - Alex trades the jewelry (I3) they received from Casey for the flowers (I1) that Blake has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want (flowers) while also ensuring that Blake is happy with the jewelry.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is now happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake is happy because they received the jewelry.
- Casey remains happy with the jewelry they already have.

**Explanation of the action:**
- The trade action is the most efficient way for Alex to achieve their goal of happiness by obtaining the flowers while also ensuring that Blake is happy with the jewelry. This single action resolves the situation effectively.
