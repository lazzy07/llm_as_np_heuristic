To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R12) where Alex and Casey are located. This is necessary for Blake to interact with them and facilitate the exchange of items.

2. **give(C2, I2, C3, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I2) to Blake. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Blake's desire for the item they want, making Blake happy.

3. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the living room (R22). This action is not strictly necessary for Blake's happiness but helps maintain the flow of the story and keeps Alex involved.

4. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey also moves to the living room (R22). Similar to Alex's action, this keeps the characters together and allows for further interactions if needed.

After these actions, Blake will be happy because they have received the jewelry they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake needs to be in the same room as Casey to receive the jewelry.
- **give(C2, I2, C3, R12)**: This is the key action that makes Blake happy by giving them the item they want.
- **move(C1, R12, R22)** and **move(C2, R12, R22)**: These actions are not necessary for Blake's happiness but help to keep the story cohesive and allow for potential future interactions.
