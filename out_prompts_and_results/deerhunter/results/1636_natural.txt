To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank with a loaded rifle and wants to get money. The clerk has no money and is at risk due to Bubba's actions. Bambi is in the forest and is not directly involved in the bank scenario but can be affected by Bubba's actions.

Hereâ€™s how the story can unfold:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot the clerk.** This action is taken because Bubba wants to eliminate the clerk as a threat and potentially take the money from the bank. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk.

2. **Bubba shoots and kills the clerk.** This action directly fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money, as the clerk will no longer be able to defend himself or stop Bubba from taking the money.

3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now take the money that the clerk had, fulfilling his desire to have money.

At this point, Bubba has successfully achieved his goal of having money, and Bambi remains alive but is not directly involved in this outcome.
