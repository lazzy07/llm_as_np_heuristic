To ensure Vince achieves his goal of being happy and not hungry, while also being wealthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **pickup(Vince, Money, Cave)**: Vince will pick up the money he has in the cave. This is necessary for him to become wealthy, as he currently has only one unit of money.

2. **pickup(Vince, Treasure, Cave)**: Vince will pick up the treasure in the cave. This will further increase his wealth and help him achieve his goal.

3. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince will travel back to the village. This is necessary for him to be in a location where he can interact with other characters and potentially find food.

4. **get_hungry(Vince)**: Vince will become hungry. This action is included to illustrate that he needs to address his hunger, which is part of his goal.

5. **eat(Gargax, Vince, Village)**: Gargax, the dragon, will eat Vince. This action is included to show that Vince's journey ends here, as he is no longer alive. However, it is important to note that Vince's wealth is achieved through the treasure and money he collected.

The story ends with Vince achieving his goal of being wealthy, even though he is no longer alive. The actions taken are necessary to illustrate the path to wealth, despite the unfortunate ending.
