**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the laundry and kitchen, Roy finds himself in the gym with the bully. The bully is preoccupied with his workout, giving Roy a moment to act. Knowing that he needs to escape and that the bully is a threat, Roy decides to take a bold step. He stealthily approaches the bully and, with the knife he stole from the kitchen, he kills the bully. This act eliminates the immediate threat to both himself and Ernest, allowing Roy to feel safe for the first time in a long while.

With the bully dead, Roy quickly moves to lock the gym door, ensuring that no one can enter and discover what has happened. He then heads to the hallway, where he puts on the civilian clothes he had seen in the laundry room earlier. Now disguised, he makes his way to the highway. With the disguise in place, he successfully escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of staying alive and free.
