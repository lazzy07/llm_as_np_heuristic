To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). Given the current situation, hereâ€™s how the story unfolds:

1. **Casey (C2) moves from the dining room (R22) to the living room (R12)**: This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex (C1) to interact with them and potentially get the jewelry.

2. **Blake (C3) tells Casey (C2) that Alex wants the jewelry (I2)**: This action is a lie because Alex actually wants the chocolates (I1). However, Casey believes this information and will act on it, thinking they need to help Alex to get what they want.

3. **Casey (C2) picks up the jewelry (I2) from the living room (R12)**: Now that Casey is in the same room as the jewelry, they can pick it up, which is essential for them to achieve their goal.

4. **Casey (C2) moves from the living room (R12) to the dining room (R22)**: This action is taken to put the jewelry down in a safe place, as Casey may want to interact with Blake or Alex again.

5. **Casey (C2) puts down the jewelry (I2) in the dining room (R22)**: This action is necessary to ensure that Casey can later retrieve the jewelry without any issues.

6. **Blake (C3) moves from the living room (R12) to the dining room (R22)**: Blake needs to follow Casey to see what they are doing and potentially help them.

7. **Blake (C3) picks up the jewelry (I2) from the dining room (R22)**: Blake picks up the jewelry, thinking it might help Casey.

8. **Blake (C3) gives the jewelry (I2) to Casey (C2) in the dining room (R22)**: This action is crucial as it directly helps Casey achieve their goal of happiness by giving them the item they want.

Now, Casey has the jewelry, and they are happy.
