To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the chocolates (I2). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Blake picks up the chocolates (I2) from the dining room (R21). This is essential for Blake to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room (R22) where Alex and Casey are located. This is important for Blake to be with the other characters after obtaining the chocolates.

4. **give(C2, I2, C2, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to themselves (C2) in the living room (R22). This action is a bit redundant but emphasizes that Blake now has the chocolates and is happy.
