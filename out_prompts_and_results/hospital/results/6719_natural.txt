**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that she has three patients in the admissions room, decides to prioritize their care. She first admits Young to Exam Room A, increasing her workload to 4. Next, she assesses Young in Exam Room A, but due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis instead of Flaze. She treats Young with steroids, which is incorrect, and Young dies.

Next, Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Exam Room B, increasing her workload to 4 again. She assesses Ross in Exam Room B and, again due to her high workload, mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis instead of Flaze. She treats Ross with steroids, which is also incorrect, and Ross dies.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Exam Room C, increasing her workload to 4. She assesses Jones in Exam Room C and, due to her high workload, mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis instead of Flaze. She treats Jones with steroids, which is incorrect, and Jones dies.
