Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A to determine their symptoms. Since Young is experiencing Unknown symptoms, Hathaway cannot accurately diagnose them. However, with a workload of 2, Hathaway is still able to treat Young. Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, mistakenly believing they have Flaze. Young, however, has Jarkis and does not respond to the treatment, but survives due to the nature of the disease. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Jones. Upon assessing Jones, Hathaway discovers that Jones is experiencing a fever, indicating Flaze. Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, successfully curing them. 

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions again to assess Ross. Upon assessing Ross, Hathaway finds that Ross has a rash, indicating Jarkis. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, successfully curing them as well.

In the end, all patients are alive and healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal.
