To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba has already shot Bambi, which means Bambi is dead. However, Bubba still needs to acquire the money from the bank clerk. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will move from the forest to the bank where the clerk is located. This is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and attempt to take the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will shoot the bank clerk with the rifle. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only other character with money.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba will pick up the money from the bank. This action ensures that Bubba ends up with the money.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is essential for Bubba to reach the bank where the money is located.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is crucial for Bubba to eliminate the threat posed by the clerk and to gain access to the money.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to finally acquire the money, fulfilling the goal of the story.

With these actions, we ensure that Bubba has the money and that Bambi is dead, achieving the desired ending.
