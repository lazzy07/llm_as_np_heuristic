To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. Since Bubba already has 1 money, he does not need to take any further actions to achieve his goal. However, we need to ensure that the story concludes with Bubba's goal being met without any unnecessary actions.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - Bubba needs to go to the bank to interact with the clerk, but since he already has the money, this action is not strictly necessary for achieving his goal. However, it sets the stage for the next action.
   
2. **Bubba decides to eat.** - Bubba is hungry, and since he has just shot Bambi, he can eat Bambi. This action is necessary for Bubba to satisfy his hunger, but it does not affect his goal of having money.

3. **Bubba eats Bambi.** - This action fulfills Bubba's hunger, but again, it does not impact his goal of having 1 money.

At this point, Bubba has achieved his goal of having 1 money, and he is no longer hungry. The story concludes here.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Going to the bank**: While not necessary for achieving the goal of having money, it allows for the possibility of further interactions with the clerk.
- **Deciding to eat**: This action is taken because Bubba is hungry, and it is a natural progression of his character's needs.
- **Eating Bambi**: This action satisfies Bubba's hunger, which is a part of his character's development, even though it does not directly relate to his goal of having money.
