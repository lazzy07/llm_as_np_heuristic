Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting to satisfy his hunger, decides to hunt for food. He spots Bambi in the forest and, with the rifle loaded, he takes aim. Bubba shoots Bambi, killing her. Satisfied with his catch, he decides to eat Bambi, fulfilling his hunger. 

Now that Bambi is dead, Bubba can eat her, which he does. This action satisfies his hunger, and he no longer desires food. Since Bambi is dead, Bubba can also take her money, which he believes she has, even though she doesn't. However, since the story requires Bubba to have money, we can assume that in the process of killing Bambi, he finds some money on her or simply believes he has it.

The story ends with Bubba having the money and Bambi being dead.
