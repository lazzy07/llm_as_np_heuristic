Zoe, the space explorer, is currently safe aboard her spaceship, while the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, is on the surface. Zoe has just made peace with the Lizard, establishing a friendly relationship. However, the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the imminent eruption of the volcano.

To ensure the story reaches a conclusion where the volcano erupts, and both characters can still maintain their friendship, Zoe will take the following actions:

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports back to the surface to check on the Lizard and ensure they can both escape the danger together. This action is necessary to bring Zoe back to the planet where the Lizard is located.

2. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano begins to erupt, creating a sense of urgency for both characters. This action is crucial as it sets the stage for the impending danger that will lead to the next actions.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard walks to the cave to seek shelter from the eruption. This action is important as it shows the Lizard's instinct to find safety, and it also allows Zoe to follow.

4. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe follows the Lizard into the cave, ensuring they are both safe from the eruption. This action solidifies their friendship as they work together to find safety.

At this point, the volcano erupts, but both characters are safe in the cave. They have successfully made friends and avoided the danger of the eruption.

### Explanation of Actions:
