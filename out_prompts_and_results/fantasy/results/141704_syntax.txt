To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her current situation and the available actions. Talia is already married to Rory, which contributes to her happiness. She currently has money but no treasure. The treasure is located in the cave, where she is currently located. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia achieving her goal:

### Explanation of Actions:
- **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: This action allows Talia to collect the treasure, which is essential for her to achieve her goal of wealth. 

Now, Talia has both money and treasure, making her wealthy, and she remains happy due to her marriage to Rory.
