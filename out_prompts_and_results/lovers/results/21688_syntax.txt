To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves from the bathroom (R22) to the dining room (R21). This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex (C1) in the dining room (R21). This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves from the dining room (R21) to the bathroom (R22). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to keep the story flowing and allows Blake to potentially interact with Casey later.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to give them the flowers.
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: This is the key action that makes Alex happy by providing them with the item they want.
- **move(C2, R21, R22)**: While this action does not directly contribute to Alex's happiness, it allows Blake to exit the scene, which can be useful for future interactions.
