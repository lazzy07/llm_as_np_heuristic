To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank, and the bank clerk is also present. Bubba is greedy and wants money, while the clerk has some money. Bubba is also hungry, but his primary goal is to get money.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money from him. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants to obtain money, and the clerk has money that Bubba can take.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go back to the house. This action is necessary for Bubba to secure his stolen money in a safe place.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Once at the house, Bubba will decide to eat. This action is necessary because he is hungry, and it allows him to satisfy his hunger after the stressful encounter at the bank.

The final story is as follows:

1. Bubba, feeling greedy, decides to steal money from the bank clerk using his rifle.
2. He successfully steals the money and leaves the bank.
3. Bubba returns to the house, where he decides to eat to satisfy his hunger.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money while also addressing his hunger.
