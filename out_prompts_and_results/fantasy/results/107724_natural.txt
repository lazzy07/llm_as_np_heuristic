To ensure Vince achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.** - Rory needs to leave the cave where he is currently located to join the others in the village, where the action will unfold.
  
2. **Gargax eats Rory.** - Gargax, who is at the cave, will eat Rory. This action is necessary because it allows Gargax to become wealthy by taking Rory's wealth (if he had any) and also satisfies Gargax's hunger. Since Rory has no wealth, this action will not affect the wealth distribution but will remove Rory from the story.

3. **Vince proposes marriage to Talia.** - Vince, now in the village with Talia, will propose to her. This is a necessary step for Vince to achieve happiness through marriage.

4. **Talia accepts Vince's proposal.** - Talia accepts the proposal, which is essential for both characters to become happy.

5. **Vince and Talia get married.** - This action solidifies their relationship and ensures Vince's happiness.

6. **Vince picks up the money.** - Vince will pick up the money that he has, ensuring he is wealthy.

By following these actions, Vince achieves his goals of happiness and wealth while ensuring he is not hungry.
