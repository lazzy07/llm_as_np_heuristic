To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba loads the ammunition into the rifle.**  
   - This action is necessary because Bubba needs a loaded gun to either steal the money from the clerk or to shoot Bambi if he decides to hunt her.

2. **Bubba goes to the bank.**  
   - Bubba needs to go to the bank to confront the clerk and attempt to take the money.

3. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now steal the money from the clerk, achieving the goal of Bubba having the money.

4. **Bubba goes to the forest.**  
   - After stealing the money, Bubba can go to the forest where Bambi is located.

5. **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi.**  
   - This action ensures that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the goal.
