**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Hathaway, Jones, Fever, PatientRoomA**: Hathaway assesses Jones in PatientRoomA to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but assessing is necessary to identify if Jones has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Treat Hathaway, Jones, Antibiotics, PatientRoomA**: After assessing, Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, believing he has Flaze. If Jones indeed has Flaze, he will become healthy.

3. **Walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomA, Admissions)**: After treating Jones, Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess and treat the other patients, Ross and Young, who are still waiting.

**Explanation of Actions:**

- **Assess**: This action is crucial as it allows Hathaway to identify Jones's symptoms. Without this step, Hathaway cannot determine the correct treatment.
  
- **Treat**: This action is essential to ensure that Jones receives the necessary treatment for his condition. If Jones has Flaze, he will recover; if not, there is a risk of him dying, but Hathaway must act to help him.

- **Walk**: This action allows Hathaway to move to the admissions room to check on the other patients, ensuring that all patients are attended to and that Hathaway can continue to work towards their goal of making all patients healthy.
