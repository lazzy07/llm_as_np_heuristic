**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Roy finds himself in the hallway. He knows that Ernest is in the laundry room with the pack of cigarettes, but they are both threatened by the bully in the gym. Roy decides to take action to ensure their safety and secure their escape.

Roy crawls through the vents to reach the gym, where he knows the bully is currently engaged in recreation time. Once inside the gym, he sees the bully distracted. With the knife he stole from the kitchen, Roy takes the opportunity to kill the bully, eliminating the threat to both himself and Ernest.

With the bully dead, Roy can now safely return to the laundry room to inform Ernest. They can then plan their escape together.
