To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit attacks the hero.** This action is necessary because the bandit needs to eliminate the hero, who is a potential threat and is currently at the market. The bandit is armed and can attack the unarmed hero.

2. **The bandit loots the hero's coin from the corpse.** After defeating the hero, the bandit can take the hero's coin, which adds to her collection of coins.

3. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.** This action is taken to return to the bandit camp, where the bandit can store her coins.

4. **The bandit places the coins in the chest at the bandit camp.** This final action ensures that the bandit achieves her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. The bandit attacks the hero, killing him. This removes a potential threat and allows the bandit to take the hero's coin.
2. The bandit loots the hero's coin from the corpse, increasing her total coins.
3. The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp, where she can safely store her coins.
4. The bandit places the coins in the chest at the bandit camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

The actions are necessary to ensure the bandit achieves her goal while eliminating the hero as a threat.
