To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, who is carrying a coin. This action is necessary for the Bandit to increase her coin count, as she is currently at the Market and Tom is also there. Since Tom is armed but the Bandit is also armed, the Bandit can successfully rob Tom without any risk of being attacked.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the Camp. This action is necessary for the Bandit to secure her coins in the chest at the bandit camp, which is part of her goal.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the Camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has coins in her possession, fulfilling her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **Walking to Camp**: This action is necessary to move the Bandit to a safe location where she can store her coins.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This final action ensures that the Bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins.
