**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to admit Ross to an exam room. She assigns Ross to Patient Room B, increasing her workload to 2. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C to determine his symptoms. Since her workload is still below 3, she accurately identifies that Jones is experiencing a fever, which indicates he has Flaze. 

Dr. Hathaway then treats Jones with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze, which successfully makes Jones healthy. 

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to check on Young, who is still waiting there.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Admit Ross to Patient Room B**: This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room, allowing Dr. Hathaway to manage her workload effectively and prepare to assess and treat all patients.

2. **Assess Jones in Patient Room C**: This action is crucial for Dr. Hathaway to determine the correct diagnosis for Jones. Since her workload is below 3, she can accurately assess his symptoms.

3. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: This action is essential for Jones to achieve his goal of being alive and healthy. Since he has Flaze, the antibiotics will cure him.

4. **Walk back to Admissions**: This action is not directly related to Jones's goal but is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to continue her duties and check on the other patients.
