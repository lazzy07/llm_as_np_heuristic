In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I3). 

Given the current situation, the following actions will help Blake achieve their goal:

1. **trade(Blake, I1, Alex, I3, R22)**: Blake can trade the jewelry (I1) they have with Alex for the flowers (I3) that Alex wants. This action is necessary because it directly addresses both Blake's desire to make Alex happy and Blake's own happiness by ensuring they have an item they want.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be happy because they now have the flowers (I3).
- Blake will also be happy because they have traded for the jewelry (I1), which they possess.

Thus, Blake achieves their goal of being happy while also making Alex happy.
