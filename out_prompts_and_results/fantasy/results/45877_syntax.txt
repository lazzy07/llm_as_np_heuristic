To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items available. Since Talia has already accepted proposals from both Vince and Rory, she can leverage her relationships to gain wealth. 

Here's the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's goal:

1. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels to the cave where the treasure is located. This is necessary for her to access the treasure, which will help her achieve wealth.

2. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is crucial as it directly contributes to her wealth.

3. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia returns to the village with the treasure. This is necessary for her to be in a location where she can interact with the other characters.

4. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia marries Vince. This action will make both Talia and Vince happy, fulfilling Talia's goal of happiness.

5. **marry(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia marries Rory. This action will also make both Talia and Rory happy, further ensuring Talia's happiness.

At this point, Talia has achieved both her goals of being happy (through marriage to both Vince and Rory) and wealthy (by acquiring the treasure).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Traveling to the cave** allows Talia to access the treasure, which is essential for her wealth.
- **Picking up the treasure** is the direct action that increases her wealth.
- **Traveling back to the village** is necessary to interact with her suitors and finalize her relationships.
- **Marrying Vince and Rory** ensures Talia's happiness, as both relationships are accepted and will make her happy.
