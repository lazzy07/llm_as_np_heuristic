In this story, we need to ensure that Dr. Hathaway successfully treats all patients to achieve their goal of having all hospital patients healthy. Given the current situation, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in PatientRoomB**: Dr. Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. Since Young is currently in PatientRoomB, this action is necessary to identify whether Young has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash). This is crucial because Hathaway's workload is already at 3, and if they treat without assessing, they risk making a mistake.

2. **Treat Young with the appropriate treatment**: After assessing Young, Dr. Hathaway will treat Young with the correct treatment based on the symptoms identified. If Young has Flaze, they will receive antibiotics; if Young has Jarkis, they will receive steroids. This action is essential to ensure that Young becomes healthy.

By taking these two actions, Dr. Hathaway can effectively manage their workload and ensure that Young is treated correctly, thus achieving their goal of having all patients healthy.
