To achieve Talia's goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Talia picks up the treasure at the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary because Talia needs to acquire wealth, and the treasure is located in the cave.

2. **Talia travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Talia needs to go to the village to interact with Gargax, who is there and has the potential to help her achieve her goal.

3. **Talia proposes marriage to Gargax.**  
   - Since Gargax is wealthy and does not care about happiness, proposing marriage to him is a strategic move for Talia to secure wealth.

4. **Gargax accepts Talia's proposal.**  
   - This action is necessary for Talia to achieve happiness through marriage, as Gargax's acceptance will lead to their marriage.

5. **Talia and Gargax get married.**  
   - This final action solidifies Talia's happiness and wealth, as she is now married to a wealthy dragon.

By following these actions, Talia achieves her goals of being happy and wealthy.
