The bandit, having successfully looted the medicine from the merchant, now seeks to maximize her coins. She knows that the guard is a threat to her freedom, so she decides to take action to eliminate that threat.

1. **The bandit attacks the guard.** This action is taken because the bandit wants to eliminate the guard, who poses a risk to her criminal activities. Since the guard is not armed, the bandit can attack without fear of retaliation.

2. **The bandit loots the guard's sword.** After successfully attacking the guard, the bandit can loot the sword from the guard's corpse. This action is necessary for the bandit to arm herself further, ensuring her safety and ability to defend against any future threats.

3. **The bandit walks to the bandit camp.** With the guard eliminated and now armed with a sword, the bandit walks back to her camp. This action is essential for her to secure her coins and the medicine in a safe location.

4. **The bandit places the medicine and the hero's coin in the chest at the bandit camp.** This final action allows the bandit to achieve her goal of having as many coins as possible in her possession, as well as securing the medicine she looted.

By following these actions, the bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as she can or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
