Tom, armed with the merchant's sword, stands at the crossroads with the merchant and the bandit. Knowing that the merchant has the medicine he needs, Tom decides to take action. He approaches the bandit, who is also at the crossroads, and uses his sword to attack her. The bandit, unarmed, cannot defend herself and is killed. Tom then loots the bandit's corpse, taking her sword and any coins she might have. 

With the bandit defeated, Tom turns to the merchant and asks for the medicine. The merchant, seeing that Tom has just defeated the bandit, willingly hands over the medicine to him. Tom now has the medicine he wanted and can return to the cottage.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Tom attacks the bandit**: This action is necessary for Tom to eliminate the threat posed by the bandit, allowing him to safely obtain the medicine from the merchant.
2. **Tom loots the bandit's corpse**: This action allows Tom to potentially gain more resources (like coins or the bandit's sword) that could be useful later, although his primary goal is to get the medicine.
3. **Tom asks the merchant for the medicine**: After defeating the bandit, Tom can now safely request the medicine from the merchant, achieving his goal.
