**Story Completion:**

As the first day comes to a close, Roy, still in the hallway, decides to take a risk. He knows that the bully is locked in the gym and believes he has a chance to escape. He quickly crawls through the vents to reach the highway outside the prison. Once he arrives at the highway, he puts on the civilian clothes he had previously seen in the laundry room. With the disguise on, he feels a surge of hope and confidence. 

Roy takes a deep breath and steps onto the highway, successfully escaping from the prison. He has achieved his goal of being alive and free, with the pack of cigarettes still in his possession.
