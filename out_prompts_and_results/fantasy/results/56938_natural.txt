To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes happy or wealthy or both. Given the current situation, Talia is married to Rory, who has the treasure, and Vince has the money. Talia's happiness is currently at 0, and she has no wealth. 

Hereâ€™s how we can achieve Talia's happiness or wealth:

1. **Rory gives Talia the treasure.** This action will make Talia wealthy since she will now possess the treasure that Rory has. Since Talia wants to be wealthy, this action directly contributes to her goal.

2. **Talia becomes happy.** Since Talia is now wealthy (having the treasure), she will feel happy as a result of achieving her goal of wealth.

Now, let's outline the actions taken:

1. **Rory gives Talia the treasure.** (This makes Talia wealthy.)
2. **Talia becomes happy.** (This fulfills Talia's desire for happiness.)

With these two actions, Talia achieves her goals of becoming both happy and wealthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Rory gives Talia the treasure:** This action is necessary because it directly addresses Talia's desire to be wealthy. By giving her the treasure, Rory helps Talia achieve her goal.
- **Talia becomes happy:** This action is a result of Talia now being wealthy. Since her goal is to be happy, this action is essential to fulfill her desire.
