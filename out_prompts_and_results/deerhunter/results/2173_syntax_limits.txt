To complete the story with the goal of Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can take the following actions:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, feeling greedy and wanting money, decides to steal from the bank clerk. Since he has a loaded rifle, he can intimidate the clerk into giving him the money.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Although Bambi is already dead, Bubba can eat her to satisfy his hunger. This action is not strictly necessary for the goal of having money, but it fulfills Bubba's hunger.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk, achieving the goal of Bubba having money. The rifle is used as a means of intimidation, making the action possible.
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: This action is included to show that Bubba is also addressing his hunger, although it is not necessary for the primary goal of acquiring money.
