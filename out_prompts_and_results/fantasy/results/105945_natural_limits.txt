In the cave, Talia and Rory are married, but Rory is still not wealthy. To achieve his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, Rory needs to acquire some money. Since Vince has the money and is at the village, Rory can take action to get the money.

Rory decides to travel to the village to confront Vince and take the money from him. This action is necessary for Rory to achieve his goal of wealth, as he cannot be happy without it.

1. Rory travels from the cave to the village.
2. Rory takes the money from Vince's dead body (assuming Vince is dead for the sake of this action).

Now, Rory has the money, which fulfills his goal of being wealthy, and he is already married to Talia, which contributes to his happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Travel to the village**: Rory needs to go to where the money is located, which is with Vince in the village.
