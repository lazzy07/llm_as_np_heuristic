In this story, the Bandit wants to be carrying as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. The Bandit is currently at the Crossroads, and the Bandit has a sword, which allows her to rob other characters. The Bandit can see both Tom and the Merchant at the Crossroads.

To achieve her goal, the Bandit will rob the Merchant, who is carrying the medicine and a sword. Since the Merchant is armed, the Bandit cannot attack her directly, but she can still rob her because the Merchant is not carrying any coins. 

Hereâ€™s the action taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, Medicine, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The Bandit robs the Merchant, taking the medicine. This action is necessary for the Bandit to achieve her goal of having items in her possession, as she can later sell or use the medicine to gain coins.

After this action, the Bandit has the medicine, which she can use to trade for coins or keep for herself, thus achieving her goal of having items in her possession.

### Explanation of the Action:
- The Bandit robs the Merchant because she is the only character at the Crossroads who has an item that the Bandit can take. The Bandit is not interested in the medicine for its own sake but rather as a means to gain value (coins) later.
