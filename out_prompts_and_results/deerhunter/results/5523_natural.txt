To complete the story, Bubba needs to acquire money from the bank clerk. Since Bubba has a rifle loaded with ammunition, he can use it to intimidate the clerk into giving him the money. Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal of having 1 money:

1. **Bubba decides to steal from the clerk.** (Bubba wants to have money, and the clerk has 1 money.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle, which allows him to steal from the clerk.)

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Deciding to steal from the clerk**: This action is necessary because Bubba's goal is to obtain money, and the clerk is the only character with money available.
- **Stealing the money from the clerk**: This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having 1 money. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money without any resistance from the clerk.

After these actions, Bubba will have 1 money, achieving his goal.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba decides to steal from the clerk.",
    "Bubba steals the money from the clerk."
  ]
}
