To ensure Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, we need to focus on the actions that will lead to his treatment and recovery. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, we need to be cautious about the assessments and treatments to avoid mistakes. 

Here’s the completed story:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.
   
2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway treats Ross with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has a rash, he will be treated with steroids for Jarkis, or if he has a fever, he will be treated with antibiotics for Flaze. This action is crucial for Ross to become healthy.

3. **Walk Young to PatientRoomB**: Young walks from Admissions to PatientRoomB to see Ross. This action is not directly related to Ross's treatment but helps to ensure that Young is aware of Ross's condition and can support him.

4. **Assess Young**: Hathaway assesses Young in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Young is also treated if he has any symptoms.

5. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway treats Young with the appropriate treatment. This ensures that both Ross and Young are healthy.

Now, let’s summarize the actions taken:

- **Assess Ross**: To determine his symptoms.
- **Treat Ross**: To ensure he becomes healthy.
- **Walk Young to PatientRoomB**: To support Ross.
- **Assess Young**: To determine his symptoms.
- **Treat Young**: To ensure he becomes healthy.

This sequence of actions ensures that Ross achieves his goal of being alive and healthy, as well as Young.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, ?, PatientRoomB)",
    "walk(Young, Admissions, PatientRoomB)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, ?, PatientRoomB)"
  ]
}
``` 

Note: The specific symptoms and treatments for Ross and Young are represented with a question mark (?) as they depend on the assessment results.
