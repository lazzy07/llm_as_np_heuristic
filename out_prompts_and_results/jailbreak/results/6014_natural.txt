**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Ernest, feeling the weight of the bully's threat, decides to take action. He knows he needs to protect himself and Roy. 

1. **Ernest moves to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to get closer to Roy and the gym where the bully is.)
   
2. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (By locking the gym door, Ernest prevents the bully from easily accessing Roy, giving them both a chance to strategize.)

3. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This allows Ernest to enter the gym without being seen by the bully, maintaining the element of surprise.)

4. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** (This action is crucial as it eliminates the threat to both Ernest and Roy, ensuring their safety.)

5. **Ernest and Roy put on the civilian clothes.** (Disguising themselves is essential for their escape from the prison.)

6. **Ernest and Roy escape to the highway.** (This final action achieves their goal of being alive and free, away from the prison and the bully's threats.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to ensure that Ernest and Roy can protect themselves from the bully and ultimately escape the prison. Moving to the hallway and locking the gym door are strategic moves to isolate the bully. Crawling through the vents allows for stealth, and killing the bully is a necessary act of self-defense. Finally, putting on civilian clothes and escaping to the highway fulfills their desire to be alive and free.
