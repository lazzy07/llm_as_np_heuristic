To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe will initiate a peace-making action with the Lizard while they are both in the cave. This action is crucial because it allows them to establish a friendly relationship, which is one of Zoe's primary goals.

2. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: After making peace, Zoe will walk from the cave to the surface. This action is necessary to ensure that Zoe is not in the cave when the volcano erupts, as the surface is currently dangerous.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts. This action is included to show the danger of the surface and to highlight the importance of Zoe's previous actions in ensuring her safety.

By making peace with the Lizard, Zoe achieves her goal of making friends. Walking to the surface after making peace ensures that she is safe from the eruption.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to be friends. The Lizard, understanding Zoe's intentions, agrees to be friends. This action is essential for Zoe to achieve her goal of making friends.

2. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: After establishing a friendship, Zoe decides to leave the cave and walk to the surface. This is a strategic move to avoid the impending danger of the volcano.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but Zoe is safe on the surface because she left the cave after making peace with the Lizard.

In the end, Zoe is healthy, safe, and has made a friend in the Lizard.
