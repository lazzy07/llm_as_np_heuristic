Tom, armed with the merchant's sword, stands at the crossroads, where the bandit has just attacked the merchant. Seeing the bandit still at the crossroads, Tom decides to take action. 

1. **Tom attacks the bandit**: Since Tom is armed and the bandit is not, he can attack and kill her. This action is necessary for Tom to eliminate the threat and secure the medicine.
   
2. **Tom loots the bandit's corpse**: After defeating the bandit, Tom can loot her body to retrieve the medicine that the merchant had. This action is crucial for Tom to achieve his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.

3. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage**: With the medicine in hand, Tom can now walk back to the cottage, fulfilling his goal.

This sequence of actions allows Tom to successfully achieve his objective of being at the cottage with the medicine while eliminating the bandit threat.
