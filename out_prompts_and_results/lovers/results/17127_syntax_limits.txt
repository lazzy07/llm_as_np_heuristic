In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy, but they are not happy yet. Casey (C3) is already happy because they have the chocolates (I3). Blake (C2) wants the flowers (I2) to be happy, but they are not happy yet either. 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the simplest action is for Casey to give the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

Here’s the action that will be taken:

1. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the dining room (R22).

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex (C1) will be happy because they now have the jewelry (I1).
- Blake (C2) will still be unhappy because they do not have the flowers (I2).
- Casey (C3) will still be happy because they have the chocolates (I3).

This action is necessary and sufficient for Alex to achieve their goal of happiness.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

  "plan": ["give(C3, I1, C1, R22)"]
}
