In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the flowers (I1) to be happy, but they are currently with Casey (C3). To achieve their goal, Alex needs to get the flowers from Casey. 

Here’s the shortest story to achieve Alex's goal:

1. **Trade**: Alex can trade the item they have (chocolates, I2) with Casey for the flowers (I1). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want while also giving Casey something in return, which may help Casey feel happy as well.

The actions taken are as follows:

- **trade(C1, I2, C3, I1, R21)**: Alex trades the chocolates they picked up for the flowers that Casey has. After this action, Alex will have the flowers they wanted, making them happy.

After this trade, the happiness states will be:
- Alex (C1) is happy because they have the flowers (I1).
- Casey (C3) is still unhappy because they have given away the flowers but received chocolates (I2) in return.

This action is sufficient for Alex to achieve their goal of happiness.
