Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room B, realizes that both Jones and Ross are still in the admissions room and need to be assigned to exam rooms for assessment. With a workload of 3, Hathaway is at risk of making a mistake if they try to assess too many patients at once. 

1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is necessary to reduce Hathaway's workload and ensure that Ross can be assessed for any symptoms. 

2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.**  
   - This action allows Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms. Since Ross is alive and healthy, he is likely experiencing one of the two diseases. 

3. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids.**  
   - Assuming Ross has Jarkis (the only disease that could be misdiagnosed due to Hathaway's workload), this treatment will ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

After these actions, Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated Ross, reducing their workload and ensuring that at least one patient is healthy. 

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Admitting Ross to Patient Room A allows Hathaway to manage their workload effectively and ensures that Ross can be assessed.
- Assessing Ross is crucial to identify his symptoms and determine the correct treatment.
- Treating Ross with steroids is the correct action based on the assumption that he has Jarkis, which leads to a successful outcome.
