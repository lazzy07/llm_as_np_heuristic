To ensure Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room C**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Ross based on Assessment**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This is crucial for Ross to become healthy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom(Ross), PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room C. This action is necessary to determine whether Ross has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash). Since Hathaway's workload is currently 2, there is no risk of making a mistake in the diagnosis.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment, PatientRoomC)**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him with the correct treatment based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is essential for Ross to recover and achieve his goal of being healthy.
