To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to navigate the current situation strategically. Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired outcome:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom needs to leave the market and head towards the crossroads. This is necessary because he cannot go directly to the cottage from the market.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: After reaching the crossroads, Tom can now walk to the cottage, which is his ultimate destination.

This sequence of actions allows Tom to successfully reach the cottage while carrying the medicine he looted from the merchant. The actions are straightforward and necessary to achieve Tom's goal without any conflict or unnecessary complications.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: This action is essential for Tom to transition from the market, where he currently is, to the crossroads, which is the only path leading to the cottage.
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action allows Tom to finally reach his goal of being at the cottage.
