To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know if Ross has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has a fever, he will be treated with antibiotics for Flaze; if he has a rash, he will be treated with steroids for Jarkis. This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will then assess Young in Admissions to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to provide the correct treatment for Young as well.

4. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young based on the symptoms identified. Similar to Ross, if Young has a fever, he will be treated with antibiotics for Flaze; if he has a rash, he will be treated with steroids for Jarkis. This action is essential to ensure Young becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that both Ross and Young are treated correctly, achieving the goal of making all patients healthy.
