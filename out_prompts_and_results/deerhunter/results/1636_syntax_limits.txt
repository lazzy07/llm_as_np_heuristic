To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following actions will be taken:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will shoot the bank clerk with the loaded rifle. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to eliminate the only obstacle between him and the money in the bank.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba will pick up the money from the bank. This action is essential as it fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba will go to the forest, where Bambi is located. This action is included to ensure that Bubba is in the same location as Bambi, which could lead to a potential confrontation or further actions if needed.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the story's requirement.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to eliminate the bank clerk, who is a barrier to obtaining the money.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This action directly leads to Bubba acquiring the money, which is one of the two possible endings.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: This action is included to transition Bubba to the forest, where Bambi is, although it is not strictly necessary for the goal of having the money.
