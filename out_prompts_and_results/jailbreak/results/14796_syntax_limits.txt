**Story Completion:**

After successfully disguising himself in civilian clothes, Roy crawls through the vents from the highway to the gym. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym, and he has the opportunity to lock the door behind him to prevent any escape. 

Once inside the gym, Roy locks the door, ensuring that the bully cannot get out. With the bully trapped, Roy takes out the knife he had previously stolen from the kitchen. He confronts the bully, who is taken by surprise. In a moment of desperation, Roy kills the bully, ensuring that he and Ernest are no longer threatened.

With the bully out of the way, Roy can now safely escape from the prison. He quickly makes his way back to the hallway, puts on his civilian clothes, and heads out to the highway. There, he successfully escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of being alive and free.
