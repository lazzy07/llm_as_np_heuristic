**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room B, assesses Ross again to confirm his symptoms. He observes that Ross still has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Since Hathaway's workload is 2, he can treat Ross without making a mistake. He administers antibiotics to Ross, successfully treating him for Flaze, and Ross becomes healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to assess Jones, who is still experiencing unknown symptoms. He admits Jones to Patient Room C, increasing his workload to 2 again. He then assesses Jones and discovers that he is experiencing a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, successfully curing him.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to admit Young to Patient Room A. He assesses Young and finds that he is also experiencing a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, successfully curing him as well.
