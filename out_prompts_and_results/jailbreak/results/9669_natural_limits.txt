As the first day progresses, Ernest, still in the kitchen, realizes that the bully is in the gym with Roy. Knowing that Roy is in danger, he decides to take action. He quickly grabs the knife from the kitchen, believing it might be his only chance to protect his friend.

**Action 1:** Ernest moves from the kitchen to the hallway.  
*Explanation:* This action is necessary for Ernest to reach the gym where Roy is being threatened by the bully.
