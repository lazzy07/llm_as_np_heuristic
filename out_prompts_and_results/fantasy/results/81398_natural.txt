Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's happiness or wealth:

1. **Talia travels from the village to the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary for Talia to reach the treasure, which is located in the cave.

2. **Talia picks up the treasure at the cave.**  
   - By picking up the treasure, Talia increases her wealth, which is one of her goals.

3. **Talia travels back from the cave to the village.**  
   - Talia needs to return to the village to be with Rory and to enjoy her newfound wealth.

4. **Talia becomes happy.**  
   - With the treasure in her possession, Talia's wealth increases, leading to her happiness.
