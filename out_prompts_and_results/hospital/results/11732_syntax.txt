To complete the story and ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: Since Jones is in Exam Room A, Hathaway will assess him to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Young**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms as well. This is crucial for the same reason as assessing Jones.

3. **Assess Ross**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Ross, who is currently in the Admissions room. This is important to ensure that all patients are evaluated for their symptoms.

4. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is essential to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Young**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Ross**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients correctly, ensuring they all become healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing each patient** is necessary to determine their symptoms and ensure the correct treatment is administered.
