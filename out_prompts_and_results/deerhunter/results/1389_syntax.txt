To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of getting money. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank, has a loaded rifle, and is greedy for money. The bank clerk is also present and has no money. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the bank clerk to eliminate any threat and take the money. This action is necessary because the clerk is the only other character in the bank, and Bubba needs to ensure he can take the money without resistance.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now pick up the money from the bank. This action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to eliminate the bank clerk, who could potentially stop him from taking the money. It is a direct action towards achieving his greedy goal.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to collect the money he desires after ensuring there is no one to oppose him.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba successfully achieves his goal of obtaining money while eliminating any threats in the process.
