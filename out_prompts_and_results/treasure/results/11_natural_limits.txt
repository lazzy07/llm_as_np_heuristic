Hawkins stands triumphantly over the freshly dug treasure, clutching it tightly. Silver, still believing that Hawkins has the treasure, approaches him with a grin, thinking he can persuade Hawkins to share the spoils. However, Hawkins, knowing that Silver is a pirate and might try to take the treasure by force, quickly makes a plan to escape. He runs back to the ship they arrived on, leaving Silver behind, and sails back to Port Royal with the treasure.
