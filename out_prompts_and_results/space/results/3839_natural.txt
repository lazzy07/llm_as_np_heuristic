Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface of the planet, both aware of the dangers surrounding them. The volcano is rumbling ominously, and they know they need to act quickly to ensure their safety.

1. **Zoe walks to the cave with the Lizard.** This action is taken to find a safer location away from the dangerous surface, as both characters are currently not safe. By moving to the cave, they can avoid the imminent threat of the volcano.

2. **The Lizard makes peace with Zoe again.** Although they are already friends, reaffirming their bond strengthens their alliance and ensures that they can work together to face any challenges ahead.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard stay in the cave.** They decide to remain in the cave, which is a safe location away from the erupting volcano. This action ensures that both characters are healthy and safe, achieving their goals.

By taking these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard successfully avoid the dangers of the surface and solidify their friendship, ensuring they can support each other in the future.
