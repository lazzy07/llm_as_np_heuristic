Zoe and the Lizard stand on the surface, both aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano. They have just made peace, and their friendship is a crucial foundation for their next actions. 

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** This action is necessary for Zoe to ensure her safety, as the surface is dangerous due to the erupting volcano. By teleporting, she can avoid the immediate threat while still maintaining her friendship with the Lizard.

2. **The Lizard walks to the cave.** The Lizard needs to find a safe place away from the erupting surface. The cave offers protection from the volcanic activity, allowing the Lizard to remain healthy and safe.

3. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the cave.** After ensuring her safety, Zoe decides to join the Lizard in the cave. This action reinforces their friendship and allows them to be together in a safe environment.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace again in the cave.** Although they are already friends, reaffirming their peace solidifies their bond and ensures that they can work together in the future.

By following these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also fostering their friendship.
