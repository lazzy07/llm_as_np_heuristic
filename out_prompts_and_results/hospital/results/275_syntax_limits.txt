### Story Completion

After the events that have already occurred, Hathaway, the doctor, is in Exam Room A with Young and Ross. Young is showing symptoms of Jarkis (a rash), while Ross's symptoms are unknown. Jones is still in the admissions room, and Hathaway needs to assess and treat the patients to ensure they are healthy.

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because if Ross has Flaze, he needs antibiotics, and if he has Jarkis, he needs steroids. Knowing Ross's symptoms will help Hathaway avoid making a mistake due to his current workload.

2. **Treat Young**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis with steroids, as Young is showing symptoms of this disease. This action is crucial for Young to achieve their goal of being alive and healthy.

3. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway then assesses Jones in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is important to ensure that Jones also receives the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Jones**: Finally, Hathaway treats Jones based on the assessment results. If Jones has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics, ensuring he becomes healthy.
