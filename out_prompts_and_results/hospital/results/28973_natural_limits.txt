In the current situation, Dr. Hathaway is at Patient Room A, where Ross is located and exhibiting symptoms of Fever. To ensure Ross achieves his goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will take place:

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.** - This action is necessary to clear the admissions room and allow Dr. Hathaway to focus on treating Ross. It also prepares Young for assessment and treatment, but Young is not the priority for Ross's immediate health.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.** - This action is crucial as it allows Dr. Hathaway to confirm Ross's symptoms of Fever. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is still low (1), there is no risk of making a mistake in diagnosis.

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room A with antibiotics.** - This action is essential as it directly addresses Ross's symptoms of Fever, ensuring that he receives the correct treatment for Flaze. As a result, Ross becomes healthy.

After these actions, Ross achieves his goal of being alive and healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Admitting Young to Patient Room B**: This action helps manage the flow of patients and allows Dr. Hathaway to focus on Ross without increasing workload unnecessarily.
- **Assessing Ross**: This confirms Ross's condition and ensures that Dr. Hathaway is aware of the correct treatment needed.
- **Treating Ross with antibiotics**: This is the final and most critical action that directly leads to Ross's recovery.
