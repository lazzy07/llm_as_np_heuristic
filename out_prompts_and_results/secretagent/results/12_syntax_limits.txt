The Secret Agent is determined to eliminate the Mastermind. After picking up the papers and finding the gun in the cache, the Secret Agent is ready to confront the Mastermind. The Mastermind believes the Secret Agent is still at the headquarters, which gives the Secret Agent an advantage.

1. **Move from Cache to Lobby**: The Secret Agent moves to the Lobby, where they can access the path to the Headquarters. This is necessary to confront the Mastermind directly.

2. **Move from Lobby to Office**: The Secret Agent then moves to the Office, which is adjacent to the Headquarters. This is a strategic move to get closer to the Mastermind without being detected.

3. **Kill the Mastermind**: Finally, the Secret Agent uses the gun to kill the Mastermind in the Headquarters. This action fulfills the Secret Agent's goal of ensuring the Mastermind is dead.

Each action is essential for the Secret Agent to achieve their goal of eliminating the Mastermind while navigating the locations effectively.
