To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room B to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because understanding Young's condition will help Hathaway decide on the appropriate treatment.

2. **Treat Young**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis (which is likely since they are in the admissions room and have not been treated yet), Hathaway will treat Young with steroids. This will ensure that Young becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will then assess Jones in Exam Room B (where Jones is currently located after walking from PatientRoomC). This is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms.

4. **Treat Jones**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze (which is likely since they have not been treated yet), Hathaway will treat Jones with antibiotics. This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

5. **Walk Ross to Exam Room A**: Finally, Ross will walk to Exam Room A to be assessed by Hathaway. This is not directly related to Jones's goal but ensures that all patients are accounted for and treated.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. **Assess Young**: To determine Young's symptoms.
2. **Treat Young**: To ensure Young becomes healthy.
3. **Assess Jones**: To determine Jones's symptoms.
4. **Treat Jones**: To ensure Jones becomes healthy.
5. **Walk Ross to Exam Room A**: To ensure Ross is also treated.

Hereâ€™s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom(Young), PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, steroids, PatientRoomB)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom(Jones), PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomB)",
    "walk(Ross, Admissions, PatientRoomA)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy while also addressing the needs of the other patients in the hospital.
