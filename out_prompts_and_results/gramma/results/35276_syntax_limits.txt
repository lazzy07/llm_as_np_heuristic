**Story Completion:**

After the events that have transpired, the Bandit, who is currently at the Cottage, decides to take action to achieve her goal of acquiring coins. She knows that the Merchant is at the Market, and she believes that the Merchant is carrying some coins. 

1. The Bandit walks from the Cottage to the Crossroads. 
   - This action is necessary for the Bandit to reach the Market where the Merchant is located, as there is no direct path from the Cottage to the Market.

2. The Bandit then walks from the Crossroads to the Market.
   - This action allows the Bandit to arrive at the Market, where she can confront the Merchant and attempt to rob her of her coins.

3. The Bandit robs the Merchant, taking one coin from her.
   - This action is crucial as it directly fulfills the Bandit's goal of acquiring coins without needing to kill anyone or engage in more violent actions.

At this point, the Bandit has successfully achieved her goal of carrying coins.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first two actions (walking) are necessary to move the Bandit from her starting location to the Market, where the Merchant is located. 
- The third action (robbing) is the key action that allows the Bandit to achieve her goal of acquiring coins without escalating the situation into violence or drawing the attention of the Guard.
