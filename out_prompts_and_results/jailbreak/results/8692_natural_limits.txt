**Story Completion:**

As the day wore on, Roy knew he had to act quickly to ensure both his and Ernest's safety. With the knife in hand and the bully in the gym, he made a bold decision. 

Roy moved from the laundry room to the gym, where he found the bully lifting weights. The bully, caught off guard, turned to face Roy, a sneer on his face. But Roy was ready. With a swift motion, he lunged at the bully, using the knife to defend himself and Ernest. The bully, taken by surprise, fell to the ground, no longer a threat.

With the bully incapacitated, Roy felt a wave of relief wash over him. He quickly searched the bully's pockets and found a set of civilian clothes. He knew that with these clothes, he could disguise himself and escape the prison. 

Roy returned to the laundry room, where he found Ernest. "We need to get out of here," he said, handing Ernest a pair of civilian clothes. They both quickly changed, disguising themselves as free men. 

Finally, they made their way to the hallway, where they crawled through the vents and emerged outside on the highway. With the prison behind them, they were finally free.
