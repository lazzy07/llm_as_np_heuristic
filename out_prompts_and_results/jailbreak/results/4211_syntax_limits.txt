**Story Completion:**

After completing their chores in the laundry, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, is in the hallway. He knows that the gym is locked, and the bully is inside, posing a threat to both him and Ernest. To ensure their safety and to escape, Roy decides to take action.

Roy locks the gym door, ensuring the bully cannot escape. This action is crucial because it prevents the bully from threatening them further and gives Roy a chance to escape without confrontation.

With the gym locked and the bully trapped, Roy then crawls through the vents to the highway. Once outside, he puts on his civilian clothes to disguise himself. This disguise is essential for his escape, as it allows him to blend in and avoid detection by the guards.

Finally, Roy successfully escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of being alive and free.
