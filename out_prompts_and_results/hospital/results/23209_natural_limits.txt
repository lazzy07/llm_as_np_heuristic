Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway's workload remains at 2, and he does not make a mistake. After assessing, Hathaway realizes that Jones has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway then treats Jones with antibiotics, successfully curing him.
