To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is already in the forest with Bambi's dead body, and he is hungry. He also has a rifle and ammunition, which he used to shoot Bambi. 

Since Bubba is greedy and wants money, he will go back to the bank to get the money from the bank clerk. The clerk is alive and has money, so Bubba will need to threaten the clerk with his loaded rifle to steal the money.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will achieve the goal:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba goes back to the bank to confront the clerk and get the money.
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steals the money from him.

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the bank where the clerk is located. Without this action, Bubba cannot confront the clerk to get the money.
  
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk by using the threat of his loaded rifle. This fulfills Bubba's greed and ensures he ends up with the money.

At the end of these actions, Bubba will have the money, achieving the goal of the story.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
