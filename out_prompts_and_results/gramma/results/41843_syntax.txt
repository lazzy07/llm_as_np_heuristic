To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Cottage, Crossroads)**: The bandit starts at the cottage and walks to the crossroads to be in a position to interact with Tom and the merchant.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The bandit, armed with a sword, robs Tom, who is not armed. This allows the bandit to take the coin that Tom has, increasing her total coins.

3. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit walks back to the bandit camp to secure her coins in the chest.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the bandit takes the coins from the chest at the bandit camp, ensuring she has as many coins as possible.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action is necessary for the bandit to reach a location where she can interact with Tom, who has a coin.
- The second action is crucial as it allows the bandit to acquire a coin from Tom without any risk of retaliation since Tom is unarmed.
- The third action is needed to return to the bandit camp, where the bandit can safely store her coins.
- The fourth action ensures that the bandit achieves her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
