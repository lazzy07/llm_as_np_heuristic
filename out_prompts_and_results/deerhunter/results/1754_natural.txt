To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.** - Bubba is hungry and wants to eat. Since Bambi is alive and in the forest with him, he sees an opportunity to kill Bambi for food. This action aligns with Bubba's goal of satisfying his hunger.

2. **Bubba shoots Bambi.** - With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now shoot Bambi, which will result in Bambi being dead. This action directly fulfills the condition of Bambi being dead.

3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - After shooting Bambi, Bubba can now eat the dead animal, satisfying his hunger. This action also reinforces Bubba's survival instinct.

4. **Bubba picks up the money from Bambi.** - Since Bambi is dead, Bubba can now take the money that Bambi had, which fulfills the condition of Bubba having money.

The sequence of actions leads to the desired outcome of Bubba having money and Bambi being dead.
