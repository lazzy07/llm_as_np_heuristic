To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the bank, has a rifle loaded with ammunition, and is hungry. The bank clerk is also in the bank and is aware of Bubba's presence. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will shoot the bank clerk to eliminate the threat and take the money. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants the clerk's money. 

2. **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can eat the clerk. This action is included because Bubba is hungry, and eating the clerk will satisfy his hunger while also ensuring he has no witnesses left.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba will pick up the money from the bank clerk. This action is essential as it directly fulfills Bubba's goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:
- **Shooting the clerk** is necessary to remove any opposition and gain access to the money.
- **Eating the clerk** satisfies Bubba's hunger and eliminates any potential for the clerk to alert others.
- **Picking up the money** is the final step to ensure Bubba achieves his goal of having money.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
