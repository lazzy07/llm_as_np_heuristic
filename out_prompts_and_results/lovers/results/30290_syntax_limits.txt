In this story, Alex wants to be happy by obtaining the item they desire, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Casey (C3) has the jewelry, and Alex (C1) is in the same room as Blake (C2), who has the chocolates (I2). 

To achieve Alex's goal, the following action is taken:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex trades the flowers (I3) they believe they have with Casey for the jewelry (I1). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, thus making them happy.

After this action, the situation changes as follows:
- Alex now has the jewelry (I1) and is happy.
- Casey has the flowers (I3) and is also happy because they received an item they did not have before.

The final state of happiness is:
- happy(C1) = True (Alex is happy with the jewelry)
- happy(C2) = False (Blake is still unhappy)
- happy(C3) = True (Casey is happy with the flowers)

This story is complete as Alex has achieved their goal of happiness.
