**Story Completion:**

Ernest, feeling the weight of the bully's threat, decides to take action. He knows he needs to protect himself and Roy. 

1. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This action allows Ernest to access the gym without being seen by the bully, who believes he is in the laundry room.)
   
2. **Ernest unlocks the gym door.** (This action ensures that Roy can enter the gym safely later, allowing them to confront the bully together.)

3. **Ernest waits in the gym for Roy.** (This action is necessary for coordination; Ernest needs to ensure they can confront the bully together.)

4. **Roy, still in the laundry room, puts on the civilian clothes.** (This action allows Roy to disguise himself, making it safer for him to move around without being recognized by the guards or the bully.)

5. **Roy crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This action allows Roy to join Ernest without being seen by the bully.)

6. **Roy enters the gym.** (Now that he is disguised, he can safely join Ernest.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
