To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe will attempt to make peace with the Lizard while they are both in the cave. This action is crucial because it allows them to stop any potential fighting and start building a friendship, which is one of Zoe's primary goals.

2. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: After making peace, Zoe will walk from the cave to the surface. This action is necessary to ensure that Zoe is safe and can explore the surface without the threat of conflict.

3. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard will also walk from the cave to the surface, following Zoe. This action reinforces their newfound friendship and ensures that both characters are together and safe on the surface.

4. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano on the surface will begin to erupt. This action introduces a sense of urgency and danger, but since both characters are now friends and safe, they can work together to escape.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since Zoe and the Lizard are friends and aware of the danger, they can take action to escape together.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
