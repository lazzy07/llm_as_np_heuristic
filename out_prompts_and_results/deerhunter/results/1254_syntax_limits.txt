Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, decides to take action to fulfill both needs. He goes to the forest where he knows Bambi is present. 

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba uses the rifle he picked up earlier to shoot Bambi. This action is necessary because Bubba wants to eat, and Bambi is a source of food. By shooting Bambi, he can satisfy his hunger.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba eats the deer. This action fulfills his hunger and allows him to survive.

With these two actions, Bubba achieves his goal of satisfying his hunger by eating Bambi.
