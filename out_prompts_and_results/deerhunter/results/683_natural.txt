To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following sequence of actions:

1. **Bubba loads the ammunition into the rifle.**  
   - This action is necessary because Bubba needs a loaded rifle to either threaten the bank clerk or hunt Bambi.

2. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - Bubba needs to go to the bank to confront the clerk and attempt to get the money.

3. **Bubba shoots the clerk.**  
   - This action allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who has the money he desires. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk.

4. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.**  
   - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money that the clerk had, fulfilling his goal of having money.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, and it also results in Bambi being alive since Bubba does not interact with Bambi in this scenario.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Loading the rifle** is essential for Bubba to have the means to shoot the clerk.
- **Going to the bank** is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and take the money.
- **Shooting the clerk** directly achieves Bubba's goal of obtaining the money.
- **Picking up the money** is the final action that fulfills Bubba's desire to have money.
