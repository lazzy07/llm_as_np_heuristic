To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but it is essential to assess Young to provide appropriate treatment.

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.**  
   - Assuming Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Flaze (due to the high workload), this action is taken to treat Young. If Young actually has Flaze, this treatment will make Young healthy.

3. **Dr. Hathaway reduces workload by treating Young.**  
   - This action is implicit in the treatment action, as treating Young reduces Dr. Hathaway's workload by one.

4. **Young walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - After being treated, Young can walk to Admissions to confirm their health status and check on the other patients.

5. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is taken to ensure that Jones receives attention, as they are still in Admissions and need to be treated.

6. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.**  
   - This is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.

7. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Jarkis.**  
   - Assuming Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies Jones's condition, this treatment will help Jones become healthy.

8. **Young confirms they are healthy and checks on Ross.**  
   - This final action ensures that Young is aware of their health status and can support Ross, who is still in Admissions.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The assessment of Young is crucial to identify their condition, even with the risk of error due to workload.
- Treating Young is essential for their recovery, and the assumption is made that Young has Flaze.
- Walking to Admissions allows Young to check on their own health and the health of others.
- Admitting and treating Jones ensures that all patients are attended to, which aligns with Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring patient health.
