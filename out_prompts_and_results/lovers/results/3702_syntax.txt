To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where the flowers (I1) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the flowers to interact with them.

4. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex (C1) in the living room (R22). This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.
