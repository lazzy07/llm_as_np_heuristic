To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit will walk to the Market to confront Tom, who is currently there and has just been robbed of his coin. This action is necessary for the Bandit to potentially rob Tom again or to take advantage of the situation.

2. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, taking the remaining coin that Tom has. This action is crucial as it directly increases the Bandit's coin count.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Crossroads. This action is necessary to return to a location where the Bandit can access the chest at the camp.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from Tom and place them in the chest at the bandit camp. This action fulfills the Bandit's goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Bandit starts at the Crossroads and needs to go to the Market to interact with Tom, who has just been robbed and is vulnerable.
- By robbing Tom, the Bandit increases her coin count, which is essential for her goal.
- Walking back to the Crossroads is necessary to access the bandit camp where the chest is located.
- Finally, placing the coins in the chest at the camp ensures that the Bandit achieves her goal of having coins secured.
