After the events that have transpired, Rory is in the cave with Talia, who has just taken the money from Vince. To achieve his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, Rory needs to secure the treasure in the cave.

Rory can take the treasure from the cave, which will make him wealthy. Since he is already happy due to his relationship with Talia, this action will fulfill all his goals.

Hereâ€™s the action Rory will take:
