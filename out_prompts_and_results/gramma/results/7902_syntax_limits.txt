To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following action is necessary:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom needs to leave the market and head towards the crossroads to get closer to the cottage. 

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: After reaching the crossroads, Tom can then walk to the cottage, where he can finally carry the medicine.

This sequence of actions allows Tom to reach his desired location with the medicine. The merchant is already dead, so there is no need for Tom to take any further actions regarding the merchant or the guard. The bandit is at the crossroads but does not pose a threat to Tom's goal since Tom is already armed and can defend himself if necessary.
