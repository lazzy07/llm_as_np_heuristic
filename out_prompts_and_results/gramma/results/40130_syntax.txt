To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **loot(Bandit, MerchantSword, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit will loot the Merchant's sword after attacking her. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to become armed, which is crucial for her to defend herself and potentially rob or attack others in the future.

2. **loot(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will loot Tom's coins after attacking him. This action is essential as it directly contributes to her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: The Bandit will walk from the Market to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to move to a safe location where she can store her coins.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will take the coins she looted from Tom and place them in the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action fulfills her goal of having coins in the chest.

The sequence of actions ensures that the Bandit successfully achieves her goal of accumulating coins and securing them in her camp.
