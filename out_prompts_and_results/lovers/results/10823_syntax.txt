To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R12, R21)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R12) to the living room (R21) where the jewelry is located. This is necessary for Alex to access the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the jewelry (I1) in the living room (R21). This is essential for Alex to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves from the living room (R21) to the bathroom (R22). This is a strategic move to be closer to Casey, who is currently in the bathroom.

4. **give(C1, I1, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I1) to Casey in the bathroom (R22). This action not only fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry but also helps Casey, who wants the flowers (I3) that Alex has.

5. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves from the bathroom (R22) to the living room (R21) to retrieve the flowers (I3) that are there.

6. **pick_up(C3, I3, R21)**: Casey picks up the flowers (I3) in the living room (R21). This action allows Casey to achieve their goal of happiness.

7. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the bathroom (R22) to give the flowers to Blake.

8. **give(C3, I3, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers (I3) to Blake in the bathroom (R22). This ensures that Blake is happy as well.

Now, all characters are happy: Alex has the jewelry, Casey has the flowers, and Blake has the chocolates.
