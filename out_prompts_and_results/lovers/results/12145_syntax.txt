To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where the jewelry is located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the jewelry (I1) in the dining room. This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Casey and Blake. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps maintain the social aspect of the story.

4. **give(C1, I1, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I1) to Casey (C3). This action is important because it ensures that Casey is happy, which aligns with Alex's desire for Casey to be happy.

5. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) to pick up the chocolates (I2) that they want. This action is necessary for Casey to achieve their happiness.

6. **pick_up(C3, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room. This action ensures that Casey has the item they want, making them happy.

7. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R21) to be with Casey. This action is not strictly necessary for Blake's happiness but helps maintain the social aspect of the story.

8. **give(C2, I3, C1, R21)**: Blake gives the flowers (I3) to Alex (C1). This action ensures that Alex has the item they want, making them happy.

Now, Alex is happy because they have the jewelry, and Casey is happy because they have the chocolates. Blake is also happy because they have given Alex the flowers, fulfilling their desire to make Alex happy.
