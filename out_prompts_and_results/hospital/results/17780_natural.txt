**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that their workload is too high and that they need to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to first assess Young in Patient Room A. 

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing an unknown condition. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, they mistakenly believe Young has Jarkis due to the high workload. 

2. **Treat Young with Steroids**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, believing it to be the correct treatment for Jarkis. However, since Young actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Young dies.

3. **Walk to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway then walks to Patient Room C to assess Jones, who is still in Admissions.

4. **Assess Jones in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is also experiencing an unknown condition. Again, due to the high workload, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis.

5. **Treat Jones with Steroids**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, believing it to be the correct treatment for Jarkis. Since Jones actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Jones dies.

6. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Ross.

7. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is experiencing an unknown condition. Due to the high workload, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis.

8. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, believing it to be the correct treatment for Jarkis. Since Ross actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Ross dies.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway's actions, although well-intentioned, lead to the deaths of all patients due to the mistaken diagnoses caused by the high workload. However, Dr. Hathaway's goal of wanting all patients to be healthy remains intact, even if the outcome was tragic.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Assessing Young, Jones, and Ross was necessary to determine their conditions, even though the high workload led to mistakes.
- Treating Young, Jones, and Ross was necessary to attempt to cure them, despite the misdiagnoses.
- Walking between rooms was necessary to move from one patient to another for assessment and treatment.
