To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: The Lizard will attempt to make peace with Zoe. Since they are both on the surface and not fighting, this action can help improve their relationship and establish a friendly connection.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, the Lizard will walk to the cave. This action allows the Lizard to move to a safer location, away from the dangerous surface.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Following the Lizard, Zoe will also walk to the cave. This action keeps them together and allows them to continue building their friendship in a safer environment.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once in the cave, Zoe will make peace with the Lizard again. This reinforces their friendship and ensures that both characters feel safe and healthy.

By taking these actions, the Lizard successfully achieves its goal of making friends with Zoe while ensuring both characters are safe and healthy.
