**Story Completion:**

The bandit, armed with her sword, decides to take action to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible. She walks from the cottage to the crossroads, where she encounters the hero. The bandit sees that the hero is armed but believes she can outsmart him. 

1. The bandit approaches the hero and attempts to rob him. Since the hero is carrying the merchant's sword but is not aware of the bandit's intentions, he is caught off guard. The bandit successfully robs the hero of the hero's coin.

2. With the coin now in her possession, the bandit walks back to the bandit camp, where she places the newly acquired coin into the chest alongside her other coins.

At this point, the bandit has achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as she can, as she now has both her original coins and the hero's coin in the chest at the bandit camp.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The bandit walks to the crossroads to confront the hero, which is necessary to rob him of the coin.
- The robbery is successful because the hero is not prepared for an attack, allowing the bandit to take the coin without any resistance.
- Finally, the bandit returns to the camp to secure her coins, fulfilling her goal of maximizing her coin collection.
