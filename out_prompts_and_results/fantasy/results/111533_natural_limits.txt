In the cave, Talia, Rory, and Vince are all present, along with Gargax the dragon. Talia is unhappy and desires wealth. Rory has the treasure, and Vince has the money. To achieve her goal of happiness, Talia needs to acquire wealth.

1. **Gargax eats Talia.** This action is necessary because it allows Talia to become wealthy. In this scenario, Gargax, who desires wealth and not happiness, will eat Talia, and in doing so, he will take her wealth, which is the treasure Rory possesses. Since Talia is now dead, she will not be hungry, and her wealth will be transferred to Gargax, who will then be wealthy.

This action leads to Talia's happiness because, in the context of the story, her goal of being wealthy is achieved through the transfer of wealth, even if it comes at the cost of her life.

Final plan in JSON format:
```json
{
  "plan": ["Gargax eats Talia"]
}

This story is the shortest possible while still achieving Talia's goal of becoming wealthy, albeit through an unconventional and tragic means.
