**Story Completion:**

Ernest, feeling threatened by the bully, decides to take action. He knows that the bully is in the gym and believes that Roy is still in the laundry room. To protect himself and ensure he can escape, Ernest locks the gym door from the hallway, trapping the bully inside. 

With the bully locked away, Ernest then crawls through the vents to the highway, where he puts on the civilian clothes he finds there. Disguised, he successfully escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of staying alive and free.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Lock the gym door**: This action is crucial because it prevents the bully from coming after Ernest and Roy, ensuring their safety. By locking the bully in, Ernest eliminates the immediate threat.
   
2. **Crawl through the vents to the highway**: This action allows Ernest to bypass the prison guards and any other threats, moving towards his escape route.

3. **Put on civilian clothes**: Disguising himself is essential for avoiding detection by the guards once he reaches the highway.

4. **Escape from the prison**: This is the final action that fulfills Ernest's goal of being alive and free.
