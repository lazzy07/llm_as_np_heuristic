In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is in PatientRoomC with Young, who is already assigned to that room. Ross and Jones are in the admissions room, and Hathaway's workload is currently at 3. To ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to assess and treat Young, who is already in the exam room.

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine if they are showing any symptoms. Since Young is in PatientRoomC, Hathaway can check for symptoms of either Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash). This action is necessary to identify the correct treatment for Young.

2. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway treats them based on the symptoms identified. If Young has a fever, Hathaway will administer antibiotics for Flaze. If Young has a rash, Hathaway will administer steroids for Jarkis. This action is crucial to ensure Young becomes healthy.

By performing these two actions, Hathaway can effectively reduce their workload and ensure that Young is treated correctly, achieving their goal of having all hospital patients healthy.
