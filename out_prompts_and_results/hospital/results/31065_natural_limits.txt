Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B. Since Young is experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Flaze due to the high workload. Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics. Young, however, has Jarkis and does not respond to the treatment, leading to Young's death.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Jones and Ross. Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room A and Ross to Patient Room C. Dr. Hathaway then assesses Ross in Patient Room C, where Ross is also experiencing unknown symptoms. Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies Ross has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics, successfully making Ross healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A, where Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms. Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Flaze due to the previous workload and treats him with antibiotics. Jones, however, has Jarkis and does not respond to the treatment, leading to Jones's death.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Ross, achieving the goal of having at least one patient healthy.
