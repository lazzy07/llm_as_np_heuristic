To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, which will lead to a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action starts the eruption of the volcano on the surface of the planet. It is necessary to create a dangerous situation that will lead to a character's demise.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is important because it allows Zoe to be in the same location as the Lizard, which is necessary for them to interact further.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe makes peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it allows them to become friends, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: This action causes the volcano to erupt, resulting in the death of Zoe, who is now on the surface. This fulfills the requirement of a character dying due to the eruption.

The sequence of actions leads to the desired outcome: the volcano erupts, Zoe dies, and she and the Lizard become friends before the eruption occurs.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **begin_erupt(Surface)**: Initiates the volcanic eruption, creating a life-threatening situation.
- **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Moves Zoe to the Lizard's location, allowing for interaction.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Establishes friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, aligning with their goals.
- **erupt(Surface)**: Concludes the story with the eruption, resulting in Zoe's death.
