To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). Since Casey is already happy with the jewelry (I3), we can focus on the interactions between Alex and Blake to facilitate this.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in a position to interact with the chocolates, which are the only item left that can be traded or given to Alex.

2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Blake picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room. This action is essential as it allows Blake to have an item that can be traded or given to Alex.

3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room (R22) where Alex is located. This is necessary for Blake to interact with Alex and facilitate the exchange.

4. **trade(C2, I2, C1, I1, R22)**: Blake trades the chocolates (I2) for the flowers (I1) with Alex. This action is crucial because it allows Alex to receive the flowers they want, making them happy.

5. **put_down(C2, I2, R22)**: Blake puts down the flowers (I1) in the living room after the trade. This action is not strictly necessary for the goal but helps to clarify the final state of items in the room.

After these actions, Alex is happy because they have the flowers (I1), which is what they wanted.
