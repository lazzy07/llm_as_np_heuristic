In the cave, Talia, Rory, and Vince are confronted by Gargax, the dragon. Vince, who has some money, wants to be happy and not hungry. To achieve his goal, he needs to ensure he is safe and can secure his happiness.

1. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax, wanting to be wealthy and not hungry, decides to eat Rory. This action removes one competitor for Talia's affection and wealth, allowing Vince to focus on his own goals without Rory's interference.

2. **accept(Talia, Vince, Cave)**: With Rory out of the picture, Talia can now accept Vince's proposal. This action makes both Talia and Vince happy, fulfilling Vince's goal of happiness.

3. **pickup(Vince, Treasure, Cave)**: Finally, Vince picks up the treasure in the cave. This action increases his wealth, ensuring he is not hungry and achieving his goal of being wealthy.

By following these actions, Vince successfully achieves his goal of being happy and not hungry, while also becoming wealthy.
