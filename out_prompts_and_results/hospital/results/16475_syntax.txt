To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young**: Since Young is assigned to Exam Room A, Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Ross**: Next, Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room B. This is also necessary to identify Ross's symptoms and determine the appropriate treatment.

3. **Assess Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones in the Admissions room. This is crucial as Jones is the last patient who needs to be evaluated for symptoms.

4. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat them based on the identified symptoms. If Young has Flaze, they will receive antibiotics; if they have Jarkis, they will receive steroids.

5. **Treat Ross**: Following the treatment of Young, Hathaway will treat Ross based on the symptoms identified during the assessment.

6. **Treat Jones**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Jones based on the assessment results.
