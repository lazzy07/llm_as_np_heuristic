1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano on the surface begins to erupt, creating an immediate danger for both Zoe and the Lizard. This action is necessary to introduce a sense of urgency and to push the characters to find a solution quickly.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe decides to walk to the cave, which is a safer location away from the erupting volcano. This action is taken to ensure her safety and to find a place where they can continue to build their friendship.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave. This action is important as it shows that the Lizard is willing to join Zoe in a safer location, reinforcing their budding friendship.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once inside the cave, Zoe and the Lizard reaffirm their friendship. This action solidifies their relationship and ensures that they are no longer in conflict, which is essential for both characters to achieve their goals of safety and friendship.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts fully, but since both characters are now safely in the cave, they are unharmed. This action concludes the immediate danger on the surface and highlights the success of their decision to move to the cave.
