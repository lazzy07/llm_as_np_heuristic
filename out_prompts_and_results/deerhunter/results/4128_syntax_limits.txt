To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on ensuring Bubba has the money.

Here's the final action that Bubba can take:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will go back to the bank to collect the money from the bank clerk.

This action is necessary because Bubba is currently in the forest and needs to return to the bank to obtain the money he desires. 

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Bubba will have the money from the bank clerk.
- Bambi is already dead.

Thus, the story ends with Bubba having the money.

### Explanation of the Action:
