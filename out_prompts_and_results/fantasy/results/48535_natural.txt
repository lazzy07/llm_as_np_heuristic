To achieve the goal of making Talia happy or wealthy, we need to focus on the actions that will lead to her happiness or wealth. Since Talia is already married to both Vince and Rory, we can leverage their actions to help her achieve her goals.

### Story Completion:

1. **Vince travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - This action is necessary for Vince to bring the money he has to Talia, which can contribute to her wealth.

2. **Vince gives the money to Talia.**  
   - By giving the money to Talia, Vince directly increases her wealth, which is one of her goals.

3. **Talia picks up the treasure from the cave.**  
   - This action is not strictly necessary for Talia's happiness or wealth since she has already received money, but it can further enhance her wealth.

4. **Gargax eats Vince.**  
   - This action removes Vince from the story, which may seem counterintuitive, but it allows Talia to focus on her own happiness and wealth without the complications of multiple marriages.

5. **Talia becomes happy.**  
   - With the money received from Vince and the treasure she has, Talia achieves her goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Traveling and giving money**: These actions are essential for Talia to gain wealth, which is one of her primary goals.
- **Picking up treasure**: While not necessary for her immediate happiness, it adds to her wealth, which is also a goal.
- **Gargax eating Vince**: This action simplifies the relationships and allows Talia to focus on her own happiness without the burden of multiple marriages.
- **Talia becoming happy**: This is the final goal we want to achieve, and it is reached through the accumulation of wealth.
