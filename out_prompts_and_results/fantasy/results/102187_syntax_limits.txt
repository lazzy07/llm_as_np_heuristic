In the cave, Talia and Rory are now engaged after Talia accepted Rory's proposal. However, Talia still desires wealth to be truly happy. Meanwhile, Vince is in the village with the money, and Gargax, the dragon, is in the cave with Talia and Rory.

To achieve her goal of happiness and wealth, Talia needs to acquire the treasure located in the cave. Since Gargax is also in the cave and desires wealth, Talia can use this to her advantage. 

1. **Talia proposes to Gargax**: Talia proposes to Gargax, knowing that the dragon is interested in wealth. Gargax, who does not care about happiness, accepts the proposal, which allows Talia to gain access to the treasure without any conflict.

2. **Talia picks up the treasure**: After the proposal, Talia picks up the treasure in the cave, fulfilling her desire for wealth.

This sequence of actions allows Talia to achieve her goal of being happy and wealthy through a clever proposal to Gargax, who is indifferent to happiness but values wealth.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "propose(Talia, Gargax, Cave)",
    "pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures Talia achieves her goal with minimal actions while considering the motivations of all characters involved.
