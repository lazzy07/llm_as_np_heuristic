Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, aware of the dangers surrounding them. The volcano is rumbling ominously, and both characters know they need to find safety. 

1. **Zoe walks to the cave.** This action is taken to seek safety from the dangerous surface and to find a secure place where both she and the Lizard can be safe together. 

2. **The Lizard walks to the cave.** The Lizard follows Zoe to the cave, ensuring they are both in a safe location away from the dangers of the surface.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** Although they are already friends, reaffirming their friendship in the cave solidifies their bond and ensures they can work together to stay safe.

4. **The volcano erupts.** This event occurs after they have reached the cave, ensuring that they are safe from the eruption since they are no longer on the surface.

By taking these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also strengthening their friendship.
