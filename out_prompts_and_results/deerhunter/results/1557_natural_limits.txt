Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, decides he needs money. He approaches the bank clerk, who is standing behind the counter. Bubba, with the rifle loaded, threatens the clerk and demands the money. The clerk, fearing for his life, hands over the 1 money to Bubba. Bubba now has the money he wanted.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Bubba goes from the bank to the clerk**: This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and demand the money.
