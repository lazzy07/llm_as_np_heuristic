To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes either happy or wealthy, or both. Given the current situation, Talia is married to Rory, who has the treasure, and Rory's happiness is currently at 0. Since Talia's happiness is also at 0, we can focus on actions that will lead to Talia's happiness.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will achieve Talia's happiness:

1. **Rory gives Talia the treasure.** This action is necessary because Talia wants to be wealthy, and receiving the treasure will increase her wealth. Since Rory has the treasure, he can give it to Talia, which will also make her happy as she achieves her goal of wealth.

2. **Talia's happiness increases.** This is a result of Talia receiving the treasure, which fulfills her desire to be wealthy.

Now, let's outline the story with these actions:

1. Rory, wanting to make Talia happy and knowing that she desires wealth, decides to give her the treasure he picked up.
2. Talia receives the treasure from Rory, which makes her feel wealthy and thus happy.

At this point, Talia has achieved her goal of happiness through the actions taken.

### Explanation of Actions:
