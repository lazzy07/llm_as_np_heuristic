To achieve Alex's goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake picks up the jewelry in the living room.** (Blake wants the jewelry, and this action allows him to have an item he desires.)
2. **Blake gives the jewelry to Casey.** (Blake knows that Casey wants the jewelry, and by giving it to her, he can help her achieve happiness.)
3. **Casey gives the flowers to Alex.** (Casey wants to make Blake happy, and since Blake has just given her the jewelry, she can now fulfill Alex's desire for the flowers.)
4. **Alex picks up the flowers in the living room.** (Now that Casey has given the flowers to Alex, he can pick them up and achieve his goal of happiness.)

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Blake picks up the jewelry:** This action is necessary for Blake to achieve his own happiness, which indirectly helps Alex since it allows Casey to receive the jewelry she wants.
- **Blake gives the jewelry to Casey:** This action is crucial because it allows Casey to be happy, which is important to both Blake and Alex. It also sets up the next action where Casey can help Alex.
- **Casey gives the flowers to Alex:** This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, which is the main goal of the story.
- **Alex picks up the flowers:** This final action allows Alex to achieve happiness, completing the story.
