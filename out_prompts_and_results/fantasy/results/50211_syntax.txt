To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items she possesses. Talia currently has the treasure, which contributes to her wealth, and she has proposed to Rory, who has accepted her proposal. However, she is also engaged to Vince, which complicates her happiness. 

To resolve this, Talia should marry Rory, which will make both of them happy. Since Talia already has the treasure, marrying Rory will fulfill her desire for happiness and wealth.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **marry(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: Talia marries Rory, which makes both of them happy. This fulfills Talia's goal of being happy.

Now, Talia is wealthy (due to the treasure) and happy (because she is married to Rory). 

The final story is as follows:

1. Talia proposes to Rory, and Rory accepts. They are now engaged.
2. Talia has the treasure, which makes her wealthy.
3. Talia marries Rory in the cave, achieving her goal of happiness and wealth.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["marry(Talia, Rory, Cave)"]
}
``` 

This plan is the shortest and most effective way for Talia to achieve her goals based on the current situation.
