To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry (I3), we can outline the following actions:

1. **Casey moves from R22 to R21**: This action is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as the item they want (I2) and to interact with Alex, who is currently in R22 with I1.

2. **Blake tells Casey that Alex wants I2 (the chocolates)**: This is a strategic lie by Blake to manipulate the situation. Blake knows that Alex actually has I1 (the flowers) and wants to keep Alex happy, but by telling Casey this, Blake can create an opportunity for Casey to get the jewelry.

3. **Casey picks up I2 (the chocolates) in R21**: This action allows Casey to have an item that they can use to trade with Alex.

4. **Casey moves from R21 to R22**: This action is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as Alex, who has the item Casey wants (I3).

5. **Casey gives I2 (the chocolates) to Alex**: This action is a trade where Casey gives Alex the chocolates, which Blake falsely claimed Alex wanted, in exchange for the jewelry.

6. **Alex gives I3 (the jewelry) to Casey**: This final action allows Casey to obtain the jewelry, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions in a JSON object:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C3, R22, R21)",
    "tell(C2, C3, I2, R21)",
    "pick_up(C3, I2, R21)",
    "move(C3, R21, R22)",
    "give(C3, I2, C1, R22)",
    "give(C1, I3, C3, R22)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Each Action:
1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey needs to be in R21 to interact with the chocolates.
2. **tell(C2, C3, I2, R21)**: Blake lies to Casey to create a false belief that Alex wants the chocolates, which sets up the trade.
3. **pick_up(C3, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates to use as a bargaining chip.
4. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves to where Alex is to make the trade.
5. **give(C3, I2, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates to Alex, fulfilling the lie Blake told.
6. **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry to Casey, making Casey happy and achieving their goal.
