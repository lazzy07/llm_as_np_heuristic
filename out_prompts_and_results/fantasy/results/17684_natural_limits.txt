In the village, Talia, Rory, and Vince are all present, and Gargax the dragon has just arrived. Talia wants to be happy and wealthy, and she has already proposed to Rory, who accepted her proposal. However, Talia is still not wealthy, as she has no money or treasure. 

To achieve her goal of wealth, Talia decides to take action. She approaches Vince, who has the money, and proposes to him. Vince, wanting to be happy and not hungry, accepts her proposal. This action allows Talia to marry Vince, which makes her happy, and since Vince has the money, Talia also becomes wealthy.

The actions taken are:
1. Talia proposes to Vince: This is necessary for Talia to secure the money that Vince possesses, which is essential for her goal of becoming wealthy.
2. Vince accepts Talia's proposal: This action leads to their marriage, fulfilling Talia's desire for happiness and wealth.

With these two actions, Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy.
