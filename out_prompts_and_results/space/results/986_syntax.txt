To complete the story, Zoe needs to ensure both she and the Lizard are safe and healthy while also fostering a friendship with the Lizard. Given the current situation, the volcano is a threat, and they are both on the surface, which is dangerous. The best course of action is for Zoe to teleport back to the spaceship to ensure her safety and then return to the surface to help the Lizard.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Zoe teleports back to the spaceship to ensure her safety from the erupting volcano. This action is necessary because the surface is dangerous, and Zoe wants to be safe.

2. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports back to the surface to check on the Lizard and continue building their friendship. This action is important as it allows her to return to the Lizard and work on their relationship.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe makes peace with the Lizard, solidifying their friendship. This action is crucial as it aligns with Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.

4. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave to find a safer location away from the volcano. This action is necessary to ensure both characters are safe from the eruption.

5. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave, ensuring both characters are together and safe from the volcano. This action is important for their safety and to maintain their friendship.

6. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe and the Lizard make peace again in the cave, reinforcing their friendship in a safe environment. This action is essential to achieve Zoe's goal of making friends.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goals of being healthy and safe while also making friends with the Lizard.
