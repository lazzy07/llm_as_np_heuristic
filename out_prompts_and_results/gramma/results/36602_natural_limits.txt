The bandit, armed with her sword, walks from the crossroads to the market. There, she sees the guard and the merchant. The bandit knows that the guard is focused on the hero, who is at the market, and the merchant is unaware of her presence. The bandit decides to rob the merchant, who is unarmed and vulnerable. 

The bandit approaches the merchant and, with her sword drawn, demands the medicine. The merchant, frightened and realizing she cannot defend herself, hands over the medicine to the bandit. With the medicine in hand, the bandit now has what she wanted, and she quickly retreats back to the bandit camp, satisfied with her haul.
