To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the story will focus on Gargax obtaining the treasure from the cave. Since Gargax is currently in the village and the treasure is located in the cave, Gargax will need to travel to the cave to collect the treasure. 

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **travel(Gargax, Village, Cave)**: Gargax travels from the village to the cave where the treasure is located. This action is necessary for Gargax to reach the treasure.

2. **pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)**: Gargax picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is essential for Gargax to achieve their goal of being wealthy.

3. **get_hungry(Gargax)**: Gargax becomes hungry after picking up the treasure. This action is included to reflect Gargax's state after acquiring the treasure, as Gargax's goal includes not being hungry.

4. **travel(Gargax, Cave, Village)**: Gargax travels back to the village. This action is necessary for Gargax to return to a location where they can potentially eat or interact with other characters.

5. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Village)**: Gargax eats Rory, who is still alive in the village. This action allows Gargax to satisfy their hunger, as Gargax's goal includes not being hungry.
