To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the story will focus on Gargax's actions to acquire the treasure located in the cave. Since Gargax already has the money and is not hungry, the primary action will be to travel to the cave and pick up the treasure.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Gargax travels from the village to the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary for Gargax to reach the location where the treasure is located.

2. **Gargax picks up the treasure.**  
   - This action allows Gargax to acquire the treasure, which contributes to their wealth.

At this point, Gargax has achieved their goal of being wealthy (by having both the money and the treasure) and is not hungry (as they were not hungry before traveling).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Traveling to the cave**: This is essential for Gargax to access the treasure, which is the only item left that can increase their wealth.
- **Picking up the treasure**: This action directly fulfills Gargax's desire to be wealthy, as it adds to their existing wealth.
