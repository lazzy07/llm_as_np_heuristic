Dr. Hathaway, determined to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room, allowing Hathaway to assess their conditions. Dr. Hathaway's workload increases to 3.

2. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room B.** This action is required for Hathaway to assess Young, who has just been admitted to Patient Room B.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.** During the assessment, Hathaway discovers that Young is experiencing a rash, indicating that Young has Jarkis. This is crucial for determining the correct treatment.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room B with steroids.** Since Young has Jarkis, the treatment with steroids is appropriate, and Young becomes healthy. This action reduces Hathaway's workload back to 2 and fulfills Hathaway's goal of ensuring patient health.

At this point, all patients are alive and healthy, and Dr. Hathaway has successfully achieved their goal.
