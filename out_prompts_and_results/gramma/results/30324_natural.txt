The bandit, having just attacked the merchant and realizing the guard is at the market, decides to take advantage of the situation. The bandit takes the following actions:

1. **Loot the Merchant's Corpse**: The bandit loots the merchant's corpse to take the hero's coin. This action is necessary because the bandit wants to increase her coin count without needing to go back to the camp.

2. **Walk to the Bandit Camp**: The bandit then walks back to the bandit camp, where she can safely store her coins. This action is essential for the bandit to secure her loot and fulfill her goal of having coins in the chest at the camp.

3. **Place the Coin in the Chest**: Once at the bandit camp, the bandit places the coin in the chest. This final action ensures that the bandit has achieved her goal of having as many coins as possible in the chest.

The story is short and direct, focusing solely on the bandit's actions to achieve her goal without unnecessary interactions with the guard or the hero, who is already dead.
