In this story, Zoe and the Lizard are in the cave, having just made peace with each other. They both want to be healthy and safe and to make friends. However, the volcano on the surface has begun to erupt, creating a dangerous situation. 

To ensure the story ends with the volcano erupting and a character dying, Zoe will take the action of teleporting back to the spaceship. This action will make the Lizard angry, but it will also lead to the eruption of the volcano, which will ultimately result in the Lizard's demise.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: Zoe teleports back to the spaceship, which angers the Lizard. This action is necessary to create a conflict that leads to the volcano erupting.

2. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, resulting in the Lizard's death. This action fulfills the requirement of a character dying due to the eruption.

The story concludes with the volcano erupting, resulting in the Lizard's death, while Zoe is safe on the spaceship.

### Explanation of Actions:
