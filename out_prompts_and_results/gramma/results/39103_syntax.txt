To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to navigate the current situation strategically. Hereâ€™s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **Tom walks from Crossroads to Market.** (Tom needs to go to the market to retrieve the medicine.)
2. **Tom buys the medicine from the Merchant using TomCoin.** (Tom needs the medicine to fulfill his goal.)
3. **Tom walks from Market to Crossroads.** (Tom needs to return to the crossroads to access the path to the cottage.)
4. **Tom walks from Crossroads to Cottage.** (Finally, Tom reaches his goal location, the cottage.)
