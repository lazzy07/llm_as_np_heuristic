The bandit, having just looted the hero's coin, decides to take advantage of the situation. She knows that the guard is armed and poses a threat, but she also realizes that the guard is focused on maintaining order and may not act against her unless provoked. 

To achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the bandit takes the following action:

1. The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp, taking the hero's coin with her. This action allows her to secure the coin in her chest at the bandit camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins in her possession.

This action is necessary because it directly leads to the bandit achieving her goal of carrying coins without further conflict or risk of being attacked by the guard.
