To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe will walk from the spaceship to the surface of the planet. This action is necessary for her to be in the same location as the Lizard, which is essential for building a relationship.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once Zoe is on the surface, she will attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial for establishing a friendship, as both characters want to be healthy and safe and to make friends.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe will walk to the cave where the Lizard is. This action allows her to further engage with the Lizard in a safe environment.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: In the cave, Zoe will again attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This reinforces their friendship and ensures that both characters feel safe and healthy.

5. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Finally, Zoe will teleport back to her spaceship, ensuring her safety while maintaining her new friendship with the Lizard.

This sequence of actions ensures that Zoe achieves her goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
