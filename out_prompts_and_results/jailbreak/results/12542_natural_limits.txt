**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, realizes that he needs to help Ernest. He knows that the bully is in the gym with Ernest, threatening him. Roy decides to take action. 

Roy sneaks through the vents from the hallway to the gym. Once inside, he sees the bully looming over Ernest, who is visibly shaken. Roy, still disguised, takes advantage of the situation. He quickly approaches the bully from behind and, with a swift motion, stabs him with the knife he had stolen earlier from the kitchen. The bully collapses, and Ernest is safe.

With the bully dead, Roy helps Ernest to his feet. They both know that they need to escape before the guards arrive. Roy and Ernest exit the gym together, and since Roy is already in civilian clothes, they make their way to the highway outside the prison. 

Once they reach the highway, they both put on their disguises fully and escape from the prison, achieving their goal of staying alive and free.
