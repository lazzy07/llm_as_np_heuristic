2. **U.S. Army digs a secure pit to store the Ark.**  
   - This action is taken to create a safe environment for the Ark, ensuring it is buried and protected from any future attempts to access it.

3. **U.S. Army places the Ark in the secure pit.**  
   - This action finalizes the U.S. Army's goal of securing the Ark, preventing it from being misused or causing harm.
