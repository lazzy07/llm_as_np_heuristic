To achieve the goal of having the villain control the president, we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **Coerce(Hero, President, Money)**: The villain, who currently controls the hero, can coerce the hero into wanting the president to have the money. This action is necessary because it creates a situation where the hero will act in a way that benefits the villain's goal of controlling the president.

2. **Give(Hero, President, Money)**: The hero, under the influence of the villain, gives the money to the president. This action is crucial as it transfers the money to the president, which is a key element in the villain's plan to control him.

3. **Bribe(President, Villain, Money)**: Finally, the president, now in possession of the money, can be bribed by the villain. This action is the culmination of the villain's plan, as it allows the villain to gain control over the president through the influence of the money.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Coerce(Hero, President, Money)**: This action manipulates the hero into wanting the president to have the money, setting up the next action.
