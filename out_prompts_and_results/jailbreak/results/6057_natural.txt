**Story Completion:**

Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, decides to take a risk. He knows that Roy is in the gym with the bully, and he fears for both their lives. To ensure their safety, he quickly crawls through the vents from the hallway to the gym. 

Once in the gym, he sees Roy and the bully. The bully is distracted, so Ernest seizes the opportunity. He pulls out the knife he had hidden in his clothes and swiftly kills the bully. 

With the bully out of the way, Ernest and Roy can now escape together. They both put on the civilian clothes, and since Ernest is already disguised, they head to the highway.
