In this story, Bubba is driven by greed and hunger, and he has a rifle loaded with ammunition. He is currently in the forest, where he encounters Bambi, the deer. Bubba's goal is to obtain money, and he is also hungry. 

To achieve the ending where Bubba has the money or Bambi is dead (or both), the following actions will take place:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba, feeling greedy and hungry, decides to shoot Bambi. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to potentially eat Bambi, satisfying his hunger, and it also leads to Bambi's death, which is one of the conditions for the ending.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba will eat the deer. This action satisfies his hunger and allows him to gain sustenance from the kill.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Although Bubba does not directly obtain money from Bambi, he is still driven by greed. This action reinforces his desire for money, which is part of his character's motivation.

The story ends with Bambi being dead and Bubba having satisfied his hunger, which indirectly aligns with his greed for money, as he may later sell the deer for cash.
