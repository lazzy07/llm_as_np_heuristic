After the events that have transpired, Tom is in the Market, having just attacked the Bandit. The Merchant is at the Crossroads, and the Guard is also in the Market. The Merchant's goal is to collect as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal.

To achieve her goal, the Merchant can take the following action:

1. **Walk from Crossroads to Market**: The Merchant moves to the Market to be closer to Tom, who has just defeated the Bandit and is now in possession of the Bandit's coin.

This action is necessary because the Merchant needs to be in the same location as Tom to negotiate or trade for the coins he has acquired from the Bandit. 

After this action, the Merchant can potentially buy the coins from Tom, thus achieving her goal of collecting coins without resorting to criminal activity.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)"]
}
``` 

This plan is the shortest and most efficient way for the Merchant to achieve her goal while adhering to the rules of the story.
