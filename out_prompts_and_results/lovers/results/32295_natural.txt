To achieve Alex's goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Casey picks up the flowers in the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Casey currently has the flowers in the living room, and it allows Casey to have the item they want, which is the jewelry.

2. **Casey gives the flowers to Alex.**  
   - This action is crucial as it allows Alex to receive the flowers, which is what Alex wants to be happy.

3. **Blake moves from the bathroom to the living room.**  
   - This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps Blake to be aware of the situation and potentially work towards their own happiness later.

4. **Blake picks up the chocolates in the dining room.**  
   - This action allows Blake to obtain the chocolates, which is what Blake wants to be happy.

5. **Blake gives the chocolates to Casey.**  
   - This action allows Casey to have the chocolates, which is what Casey wants to be happy.

6. **Casey gives the jewelry to Blake.**  
   - This action allows Casey to achieve their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry.

At the end of these actions, Alex is happy because they have the flowers, Blake is happy because they have the chocolates, and Casey is happy because they have the jewelry.
