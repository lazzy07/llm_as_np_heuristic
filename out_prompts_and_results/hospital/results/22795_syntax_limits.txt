**Story Completion:**

After assessing Jones in Exam Room A, Hathaway realizes that Jones is showing symptoms of Flaze, as indicated by the fever (SymptomA). To ensure Jones becomes healthy, Hathaway decides to treat him with antibiotics.

1. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. As a result, Jones becomes healthy.

Next, Hathaway turns to Ross, who is also in Exam Room A. Since Hathaway's workload is now at 2, he can still assess Ross without making a mistake.

2. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomB, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Ross and discovers that he has a rash (SymptomB), indicating that he has Jarkis.

3. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis. Ross becomes healthy as well.

Finally, Hathaway checks on Young, who is still in the admissions room. Since Young has not been admitted yet, Hathaway needs to admit him to an exam room.

4. **admit(Hathaway, Young, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway admits Young to Exam Room B, ensuring he is in the system for future assessment and treatment.

At this point, both Jones and Ross are healthy, and Young is now in the system for further care, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
