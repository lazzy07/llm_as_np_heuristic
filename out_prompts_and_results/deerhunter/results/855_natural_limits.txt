Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, decides to take action to fulfill his desire for money. He goes back to the bank, where the clerk is still present. With the rifle in hand and ammunition ready, Bubba aims the rifle at the clerk and demands the money. The clerk, fearing for his life, hands over the 1 money to Bubba. Satisfied, Bubba now has the money he wanted.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and achieve his goal of obtaining money.
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.** - This action is not necessary for the goal since the clerk willingly hands over the money. Instead, Bubba could have simply demanded the money without violence, but for the sake of the story, we can assume he uses intimidation.
3. **Bubba takes the money from the clerk.** - This action fulfills Bubba's goal of having 1 money.
