To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Rob Tom**: The Bandit will rob Tom, who is carrying a sword but has no coins. This action is possible because Tom is not carrying any coins, making him an easy target for robbery. The Bandit will take the MerchantSword from Tom, which will allow her to be armed.

2. **Rob Merchant**: Now that the Bandit is armed, she will rob the Merchant, who is unarmed and has the Medicine and TomCoin. The Bandit will take the TomCoin from the Merchant, adding to her collection of coins.

3. **Walk to Camp**: After successfully robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will walk back to the Bandit Camp, where she can store her newly acquired coins in the chest.

4. **Take BanditCoin**: Finally, the Bandit will take the BanditCoin from the chest at the Bandit Camp, ensuring she has as many coins as possible.

This sequence of actions allows the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as she can.

### Explanation of Actions:
