In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the flowers (I1), Casey (C2) wants the chocolates (I2), and Blake (C3) wants the jewelry (I3). Alex is currently in the dining room (R21) and knows that Casey is in the dining room as well. 

To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, they can give Casey the chocolates (I2) that they have, as Casey wants them. This action will make Casey happy, and since Alex is focused on Casey's happiness, it aligns with their goal.

Hereâ€™s the action taken:

1. **give(C1, I2, C2, R21)**: Alex gives the chocolates to Casey in the dining room. This action makes Casey happy because they receive the item they want.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex is still not happy because they do not have the flowers.
- Casey is now happy because they have the chocolates.
- Blake remains unhappy as they still do not have the jewelry.

However, since Alex's goal is to ensure Casey's happiness, this action fulfills that requirement.

### Explanation of the Action:
- The action of giving chocolates to Casey is necessary because it directly addresses Casey's desire, which is a priority for Alex. By making Casey happy, Alex achieves their goal of wanting Casey to be happy, even if it does not directly make Alex happy.
