Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, aware of the imminent danger posed by the erupting volcano. They both want to be healthy and safe, and they have established a friendship. To achieve their goals, they need to find a safe place away from the danger of the volcano.

1. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship**: This action is necessary for Zoe to ensure her safety, as the surface is dangerous due to the erupting volcano. By teleporting to the spaceship, she can avoid the immediate threat.

2. **Zoe teleports back to the surface**: Zoe realizes that she cannot leave the Lizard behind in danger. She teleports back to the surface to help her friend.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk to the cave**: The cave is a safer location away from the erupting volcano. By walking together, they strengthen their friendship and ensure they are both safe.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace**: Although they are already friends, reaffirming their bond in the cave solidifies their alliance and mutual support in the face of danger.

5. **The volcano erupts**: Since they are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption. This event is crucial as it highlights the danger they avoided by moving to the cave.

By following these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also strengthening their friendship.
