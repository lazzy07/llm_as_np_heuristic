In the cave, Talia, Rory, and Vince are all present, along with Gargax the dragon. Talia wants to be happy and wealthy, and she has just accepted Vince's proposal, which means she is now married to him. However, she still lacks wealth and treasure. 

To achieve her goal of being wealthy, Talia can take the following actions:

1. **Talia takes the treasure from Gargax.** This action is necessary because the treasure is at the cave, and Talia needs to acquire it to become wealthy. Gargax, being a dragon, is not concerned about happiness, so he will not resist Talia taking the treasure.

2. **Talia gives the money to Gargax.** This action is included to satisfy Gargax's desire for wealth, as he is not hungry and does not care about happiness. By giving the money to Gargax, Talia can ensure that Gargax does not retaliate against her for taking the treasure, allowing her to keep it without conflict.

After these actions, Talia will have the treasure, which fulfills her goal of being wealthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Talia takes the treasure from Gargax:** This is the primary action that allows Talia to achieve her goal of wealth.
- **Talia gives the money to Gargax:** This action ensures that Gargax is satisfied and does not pose a threat to Talia after she takes the treasure.
