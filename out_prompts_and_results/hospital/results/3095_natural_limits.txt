**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, despite being overwhelmed with a workload of 3, decides to assess Jones in Patient Room A. She mistakenly believes that Jones is experiencing symptoms of Jarkis due to her high workload. After the assessment, she treats Jones with steroids, the treatment for Jarkis. Fortunately, Jones does not have Jarkis but instead has Flaze, which means the treatment is incorrect. However, the treatment does not lead to Jones's demise, and he remains alive. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway, realizing her mistake, quickly assesses Young in Patient Room B. She correctly identifies that Young is experiencing symptoms of Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Young becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Ross. She finds that Ross is experiencing symptoms of Jarkis and treats him with steroids. Ross also becomes healthy.

In the end, Jones is alive and healthy, having survived the incorrect treatment, while Young and Ross are also healthy.
