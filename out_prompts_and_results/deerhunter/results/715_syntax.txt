To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest, has a rifle loaded with ammunition, and is hungry. He has decided to get money, which indicates his greed. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to go to the bank to get the money. This action is necessary because he needs to be at the bank to confront the bank clerk and potentially steal the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba uses his loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is necessary to eliminate the clerk, who is the only obstacle between Bubba and the money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now steal the money from the clerk. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba can return to the forest with the money he has stolen. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal but provides closure to the story by showing Bubba leaving the bank.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba needs to move to the bank to confront the clerk and get the money.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba eliminates the bank clerk, who is a barrier to obtaining the money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba takes the money from the now-dead clerk, fulfilling his greed.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba leaves the bank with the money, concluding the story.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
    "shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, achieving the goal of the story.
