To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will allow Rory to gain wealth and maintain their happiness. Since Rory is already in a relationship with Talia, who has proposed to him, we can leverage that relationship to secure happiness. Additionally, we need to ensure Rory acquires the treasure in the cave, which will make him wealthy.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Rory achieving his goal:

1. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is necessary for Rory to become wealthy, as the treasure is the only item that can increase his wealth.

2. **marry(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: Rory marries Talia. Since Talia has already proposed and Rory has accepted, this action will make both of them happy, fulfilling Rory's happiness requirement.

Now, Rory is wealthy (due to the treasure) and happy (due to marrying Talia), and he is not hungry (as there is no indication of hunger in the current situation).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: This action is essential for Rory to achieve his goal of wealth. The treasure is located in the cave, and by picking it up, Rory increases his wealth.
- **marry(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: This action fulfills Rory's need for happiness. Since he is already in a relationship with Talia, marrying her solidifies their bond and ensures Rory's happiness.
