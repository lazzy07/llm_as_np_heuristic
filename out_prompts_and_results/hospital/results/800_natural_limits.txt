Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess Ross in Patient Room A. 

1. **Assess Ross in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Since Ross is the only patient in Patient Room A, Dr. Hathaway determines that Ross has Flaze due to the fever symptom. This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to understand Ross's condition and provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Ross in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is crucial as it directly contributes to Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Admit Young to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions and admits Young to Patient Room B. This action is necessary to ensure that Young is assigned to an exam room for further assessment.

4. **Assess Young in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is also experiencing an unknown symptom. Dr. Hathaway determines that Young has Jarkis due to the rash symptom. This assessment is essential for Dr. Hathaway to provide the appropriate treatment.

5. **Treat Young in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis. This final action ensures that Young becomes healthy, fulfilling Dr. Hathaway's goal of having all patients healthy.

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats both Ross and Young, achieving the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
