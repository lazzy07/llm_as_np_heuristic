**Story Completion:**

As the four characters stand at the crossroads, the merchant sees an opportunity. She approaches the bandit, who is armed and dangerous, but she knows that the bandit is also interested in coins. The merchant offers the bandit a deal: she will give her the hero's coin in exchange for the bandit's sword. The bandit, eager to have a coin, agrees to the trade.

With the bandit's sword now in her possession, the merchant feels more secure. She then walks to the market, where she can safely sell the sword for more coins. The guard, noticing the merchant's departure, decides to follow her to ensure that no criminal activity occurs.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Merchant trades the hero's coin for the bandit's sword:** This action allows the merchant to acquire an item of value (the sword) while giving away a coin, which is still within her goal of not becoming a criminal. The bandit, being a criminal, is willing to make this trade for the coin.

2. **Merchant walks to the market:** This action is necessary for the merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring more coins. By going to the market, she can sell the sword she just obtained.

3. **Guard follows the merchant to the market:** This action ensures that the guard is present to monitor the situation and prevent any criminal activity, but it does not interfere with the merchant's goal.
