In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is in Patient Room C with Jones, who is a patient. Hathaway's goal is to ensure all patients are healthy. Since Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, they risk making a mistake if they assess or treat Jones without first reducing their workload. 

To achieve the goal efficiently, Hathaway will first assess Jones to determine their symptoms. This action will help Hathaway understand what treatment is necessary. After assessing, Hathaway will treat Jones based on the symptoms identified.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: This action is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash). It will help Hathaway determine the correct treatment.
2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate medication (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis), ensuring that Jones becomes healthy.

By following this plan, Hathaway can effectively reduce their workload and provide the correct treatment to Jones, achieving their goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
