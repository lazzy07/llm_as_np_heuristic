To complete the story while ensuring Dr. Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but assessing Young is essential to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids.**  
   - If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis (which is likely given the unknown symptoms), treating with steroids will make Young healthy. This action reduces Dr. Hathaway's workload by one.

3. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to return to Admissions to assess and treat the other patients.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms. 

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics.**  
   - If Ross is diagnosed with Flaze, treating with antibiotics will make Ross healthy. This action also reduces Dr. Hathaway's workload by one.

6. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room C.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to assess and treat Jones next.

7. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C.**  
   - This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms.

8. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics.**  
   - If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze, treating with antibiotics will make Jones healthy. This action reduces Dr. Hathaway's workload by one.

After these actions, all patients will be healthy, and Dr. Hathaway will have successfully achieved their goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing Young, Ross, and Jones**: These actions are crucial to identify the diseases affecting the patients, which is necessary for effective treatment.
- **Treating Young, Ross, and Jones**: Administering the correct treatment based on the assessment is essential for the patients' recovery.
- **Walking between rooms**: This is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to move between patients and ensure they receive the required care.
