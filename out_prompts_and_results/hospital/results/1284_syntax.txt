To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room B to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment. Since Young has a rash (symptom of Jarkis), Hathaway will administer steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Young, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess and treat the other patients, Jones and Ross, who are still in the Admissions room.

4. **Admit Jones**: Hathaway will admit Jones to Exam Room A. This is necessary to ensure Jones receives the care they need.

5. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room A to determine their symptoms.

8. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room C to determine their symptoms.
