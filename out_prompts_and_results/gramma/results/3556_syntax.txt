To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit moves to the Crossroads, which is necessary for her to interact with other characters and potentially rob or attack them.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit then moves to the Bandit Camp, where she can store her coins and avoid confrontation.

3. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant walks from the Camp to the Crossroads to meet the Bandit and potentially sell her items.

4. **buy(Merchant, Medicine, TomCoin, Crossroads)**: The Merchant buys the medicine from Tom using one of her coins. This action is crucial as it allows the Merchant to gain an item that can be sold later for profit.

5. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant then walks back to the Market, where she can sell the medicine.

6. **walk(Guard, Market, Crossroads)**: The Guard moves to the Crossroads, where he can keep an eye on the Merchant and Bandit.

7. **report(Merchant, Bandit, Market)**: The Merchant reports the Bandit to the Guard, ensuring that the Bandit is distracted or dealt with, allowing the Merchant to operate freely.

8. **walk(Guard, Crossroads, Market)**: The Guard moves to the Market to confront the Bandit, which further secures the Merchant's position.

9. **walk(Merchant, Market, Camp)**: The Merchant returns to the Camp to store her coins and the medicine safely.

10. **take(Merchant, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Merchant takes the coins from the Bandit’s chest, ensuring she maximizes her coin collection without committing a crime.

This sequence of actions allows the Merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring coins while avoiding criminal activity. The Bandit is distracted by the Guard, and the Merchant capitalizes on this situation to secure her profits.
