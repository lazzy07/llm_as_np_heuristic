**Story Completion:**

Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, decides to take a risk. He knows that the bully is in the gym and that he is threatened, but he also knows that he has the cigarettes, which could be a bargaining chip. He moves quickly through the hallway and crawls through the vents to reach the gym. Once inside, he confronts the bully.

"Listen, I have your cigarettes," Ernest says, trying to keep his voice steady. "Let's make a deal."

The bully, surprised but intrigued, lowers his guard slightly. In this moment of distraction, Ernest seizes the opportunity. He pulls out the knife he had hidden in his clothes and, with a swift motion, he kills the bully. 

With the bully out of the way, Ernest feels a rush of relief. He knows he is now safe from the bully's threats. He quickly leaves the gym, making his way back to the hallway.
