To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is not happy, and they want the jewelry, which is currently with Casey (C2). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want to interact with it.

2. **pick_up(C1, I2, R21)**: Alex picks up the chocolates (I2) from the dining room. This action is necessary because Alex needs to have something to offer in exchange for the jewelry.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) where Casey is located. This is necessary to interact with Casey and offer the chocolates.

4. **give(C1, I2, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to trade for the jewelry.

5. **trade(C2, I1, C1, I2, R22)**: Casey trades the jewelry (I1) for the chocolates (I2) with Alex. This is the final action that allows Alex to obtain the item they want.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, making them happy.
