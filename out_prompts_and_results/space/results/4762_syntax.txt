To complete the story, Zoe and the Lizard need to ensure their safety and establish a friendship. Since they are currently on the surface and the environment is dangerous, Zoe should take actions that will help them both achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: Zoe knows the surface is dangerous, and to ensure they both leave the area, she can start the eruption of the volcano. This action will force both characters to leave the surface for safety.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After beginning the eruption, Zoe will walk to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary to get to a safer location and to be in the same place as the Lizard.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once in the cave, Zoe can make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial for establishing a friendship, which is one of Zoe's goals.

4. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: Finally, Zoe can teleport back to the spaceship from the cave. This action ensures her safety as the surface is erupting.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **begin_erupt(Surface)**: Initiates the eruption to create a sense of urgency for both characters to leave the dangerous surface.
- **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Moves Zoe to the cave where she can interact with the Lizard safely.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Establishes a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, fulfilling their mutual goal of making friends.
- **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: Ensures Zoe's safety by returning to the spaceship.
