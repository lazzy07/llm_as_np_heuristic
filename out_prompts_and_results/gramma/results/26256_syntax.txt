To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Cottage, Crossroads)**: The bandit will leave the cottage and head to the crossroads to confront the merchant and the guard, who are both present there. This is necessary for the bandit to interact with them and potentially rob the merchant.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The bandit will rob the merchant of the coins she is carrying. Since the merchant is armed but does not have a sword, the bandit can successfully take the coins without facing any resistance. This action directly helps the bandit achieve her goal of acquiring coins.

3. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After successfully robbing the merchant, the bandit will walk back to the bandit camp. This is necessary for the bandit to secure the stolen coins in her chest at the camp.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that the bandit has the coins she desires, fulfilling her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action is essential for the bandit to reach the crossroads where the merchant is located.
- The second action allows the bandit to acquire coins from the merchant, which is the primary goal.
- The third action is necessary for the bandit to return to her safe location (the camp) after committing the robbery.
- The fourth action secures the coins in the banditâ€™s possession, ensuring she achieves her goal.
