To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R21) to the living room (R22) where Casey and Blake are located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with them and potentially obtain the jewelry.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

3. **put_down(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex puts down the jewelry (I1) in the living room (R22). This action is not necessary for Alex's happiness but can be included if we want to show that Alex is willing to share or display the item.

4. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves back to the dining room (R21). This action is optional but can be included to show that Alex is returning to a familiar space after achieving their goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to receive the jewelry.
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.
- **put_down(C1, I1, R22)**: While not necessary for happiness, it shows Alex's willingness to share or display the jewelry.
- **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex returns to the dining room after achieving their goal.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.
