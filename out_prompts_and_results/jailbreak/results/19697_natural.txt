**Story Completion:**

On the second day, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, is on the highway. He knows that Ernest is still in the cells and that the bully is locked in the gym. Roy's primary goal is to escape the prison.

1. **Roy moves to the highway.** (This is where he can escape if he is disguised.)
2. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes.** (He is already wearing them, so this action is implicit.)
3. **Roy escapes from the prison.** (With the disguise, he can leave the prison without being recognized.)

Meanwhile, Ernest is still in the cells, threatened by the bully. He has the cigarettes, but he knows he cannot escape without help. 

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Roy's actions are focused on escaping the prison. By being in civilian clothes on the highway, he can successfully leave without being caught.
- Ernest's situation is precarious, but since the goal is for Roy to escape, his actions are not included in the final plan.
