To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. Since Bubba already has 1 money, he does not need to take any further actions to achieve his goal. However, we need to ensure that the story concludes with Bubba's goal being met without any unnecessary actions.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to eat.** (Bubba is hungry and needs to satisfy his hunger.)
2. **Bubba eats Bambi.** (Since Bambi is dead, Bubba can eat her to satisfy his hunger.)

At this point, Bubba has satisfied his hunger and still retains his 1 money. The clerk remains at the bank, and there are no further actions needed to achieve Bubba's goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Bubba decides to eat:** This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry, and he needs to address this need.
- **Bubba eats Bambi:** This action allows Bubba to satisfy his hunger. Since Bambi is dead, this action is valid and helps Bubba feel fulfilled.

Bubba's goal of having 1 money is already achieved, and he has now also satisfied his hunger.
