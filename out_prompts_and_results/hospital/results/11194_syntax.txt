To complete the story and ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway needs to assess Jones in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, and without assessing the patients, Hathaway cannot accurately treat them.

2. **Assess Ross**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway should assess Ross in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary for the same reason as above.

3. **Assess Young**: Finally, Hathaway should assess Young in the Admissions room to determine his symptoms. This completes the assessment of all patients.

4. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment results, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. If Jones has a fever, he will be treated with antibiotics.

5. **Treat Ross**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has a rash, he will be treated with steroids.

6. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.

By following this sequence, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom(Jones), PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Jones to determine if he has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash). This is crucial for the correct treatment.

2. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom(Ross), PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure he receives the correct treatment.

3. **assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom(Young), Admissions)**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine his symptoms. This is the last assessment needed to treat all patients.

4. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics if he has a fever, ensuring he becomes healthy.

5. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, PatientRoomC)**: After treating Jones, Hathaway treats Ross with steroids if he has a rash, ensuring he becomes healthy.

6. **treat(Hathaway, Young, appropriate treatment, Admissions)**: Finally, Hathaway treats Young with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms, ensuring he becomes healthy.

By following this plan, Hathaway successfully treats all patients, achieving their goal of making them healthy.
