In the current situation, Alex is in the dining room and wants the flowers, which are with Casey. To achieve their goal, Alex can take the following action:

1. **Alex gives the chocolates to Casey.** 
   - This action is necessary because Casey wants the jewelry, and by giving the chocolates to Casey, Alex can create a situation where Casey might be willing to trade the flowers for the chocolates. 

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex is still in the dining room.
- Blake is in the living room.
- Casey is in the dining room with the chocolates.
- The flowers are still with Casey.
- The jewelry is with Blake.
- Alex is now happy because they have the flowers after trading.

This action is the only one needed to ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy.
