1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** - This action is taken to ensure Zoe's safety, as the surface is dangerous. By teleporting to the spaceship, she can avoid the imminent threat of the volcano erupting.

2. **The volcano erupts.** - This event occurs naturally in the story, emphasizing the danger of the surface. It serves as a reminder of the urgency of Zoe's actions.

3. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the surface.** - After ensuring her safety, Zoe returns to the surface to check on the Lizard. This action reinforces her desire to make friends and ensure the Lizard's safety as well.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - Although they were already friends, this action solidifies their bond and mutual understanding, ensuring that they both feel safe and healthy together.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard walk to the cave.** - They move to the cave, a safer location away from the erupting volcano, ensuring both characters are healthy and safe.

By following these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and maintaining their friendship.
