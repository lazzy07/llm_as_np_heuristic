In the dining room, Alex and Blake are both aware that the flowers are present, but Alex wants them, while Blake desires the chocolates. Casey, in the living room, is happy with the jewelry. 

To achieve Blake's goal of happiness, Blake can take the following action:

1. **Blake picks up the flowers in the dining room.** This action is necessary because it allows Blake to obtain the item they want, which is the chocolates. Since Blake believes that the chocolates are in the bathroom, they will not be able to get them directly. However, by picking up the flowers, Blake can then give them to Alex, who wants them, thus making both Alex and Blake happy.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake is happy because they have given the flowers to Alex, fulfilling their desire to make Alex happy.
- Casey remains happy with the jewelry.

Thus, Blake achieves their goal of happiness through this action.
