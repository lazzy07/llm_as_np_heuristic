To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Rob Tom**: The bandit will rob Tom at the crossroads to take the coin he is carrying. This action is necessary because it allows the bandit to increase her coin count directly.

2. **Walk to Camp**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will walk back to the bandit camp. This action is necessary to secure the coins in the chest at the camp, fulfilling her goal.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The bandit uses her sword to rob Tom, who is unarmed. This action is crucial as it allows the bandit to take the coin that Tom is carrying, increasing her wealth.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After successfully robbing Tom, the bandit walks back to the bandit camp. This action is necessary to store the coins in the chest at the camp, ensuring that she has secured her loot.

The bandit now has the coins she desired, either in her possession or in the chest at the camp, thus achieving her goal.
