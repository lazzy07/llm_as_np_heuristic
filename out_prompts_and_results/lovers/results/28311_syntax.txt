To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help accomplish this:

1. **trade(C1, I1, C3, I3, R22)**: Alex (C1) will trade the jewelry (I1) they have with Casey (C3) for the flowers (I3) that Casey has. This action is necessary because Alex needs to give away the item they have to get the item they want.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: After the trade, Casey (C3) will give the jewelry (I1) back to Alex (C1). This action is necessary to ensure that Alex ends up with the jewelry they want.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, which means Alex is happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The trade action allows Alex to exchange the item they have (jewelry) for something else (flowers) that they do not want, but it sets up the next action where they can receive the item they truly desire.
- The give action ensures that Alex receives the jewelry back, fulfilling their desire and making them happy.
