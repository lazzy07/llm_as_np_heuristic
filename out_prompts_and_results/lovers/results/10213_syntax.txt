To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the room where Alex is located (R22). This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the room (R22). This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.

3. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves back to the dining room (R12). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps maintain the flow of the story and keeps Casey engaged in the narrative.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry they wanted, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey needs to be with Alex to help them achieve happiness.
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: This is the key action that makes Alex happy by providing them with the jewelry they desire.
- **move(C2, R22, R12)**: This action is more about maintaining the story's continuity and does not affect Alex's happiness directly.
