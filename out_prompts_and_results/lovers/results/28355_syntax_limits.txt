In the current situation, Casey wants the jewelry (I3) to be happy, but they are not currently happy. Alex (C1) and Blake (C2) are both in the same room (R22) and have the opportunity to help Casey achieve their goal. 

To ensure Casey gets what they want, Blake can give the jewelry (I3) to Casey (C3). This action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

Here’s the action that will complete the story:

1. **give(Blake, I3, Casey, R22)** - Blake gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey (C3) in the dining room (R22). This action is necessary because it directly provides Casey with the item they want, thus making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be:
- at(C1) = R22; at(C2) = R22; at(C3) = R22; at(I1) = R22; at(I2) = R21; at(I3) = R22; happy(C1) = False; happy(C2) = False; happy(C3) = True; wants(C1) = I1; wants(C2) = I2; wants(C3) = I3.

Casey is now happy because they have received the jewelry they wanted.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["give(Blake, I3, Casey, R22)"]
