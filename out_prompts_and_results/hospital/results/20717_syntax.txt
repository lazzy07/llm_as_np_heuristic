To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary for the same reason as above.

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is crucial to ensure that all patients are evaluated and treated accordingly.

4. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. This will make Jones healthy.

5. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: If Ross is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids. This will make Ross healthy.

6. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids. This will make Young healthy.

Now, let's assume the following symptoms based on the actions taken:
- Jones has Flaze (fever).
- Ross has Jarkis (rash).
- Young has Jarkis (rash).

With these assumptions, the actions will lead to the following outcomes:
- Jones will be treated successfully with antibiotics.
- Ross will be treated successfully with steroids.
- Young will be treated successfully with steroids.

This ensures that all patients are healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal.
