To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the bathroom to check for the jewelry, which they believe is there.
2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the jewelry from the bathroom.
3. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey returns to the dining room with the jewelry.
4. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry to Blake, making Blake happy.

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

- **move(C2, R22, R12)**: This action is necessary for Casey to access the bathroom where the jewelry is located. 
- **pick_up(C2, I2, R12)**: Casey needs to pick up the jewelry to give it to Blake, which is essential for Blake's happiness.
- **move(C2, R12, R22)**: After picking up the jewelry, Casey must return to the dining room to give it to Blake.
- **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: This action directly fulfills Blake's desire for the jewelry, making Blake happy.

After these actions, Blake will be happy because they will have the jewelry they want.
