**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, noticing that Jones is experiencing a rash, correctly identifies that Jones has Jarkis. To ensure Jones receives the appropriate treatment, Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. As a result, Jones becomes healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway turns to Ross, who is still in the admissions room. Since Ross's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B to assess him. After admitting Ross, Hathaway assesses him in Patient Room B and discovers that he is experiencing a fever, indicating that he has Flaze. Hathaway then treats Ross with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze, and Ross becomes healthy.

After admitting Young, Hathaway assesses him and finds that he is also experiencing a rash, indicating that he has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, and he becomes healthy as well.
