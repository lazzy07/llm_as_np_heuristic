To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following sequence of actions:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.**  
   - This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry and has a loaded rifle. Shooting Bambi will allow him to eat, which is his immediate goal.

2. **Bubba shoots Bambi.**  
   - This action directly results in Bambi being dead, fulfilling one of the conditions of the ending.

3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.**  
   - After shooting Bambi, Bubba can now eat the dead animal, satisfying his hunger.

4. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - Bubba needs to go to the bank to confront the clerk and potentially take the money.

5. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, achieving the goal of Bubba having the money.

This sequence of actions ensures that either Bambi is dead or Bubba has the money, fulfilling the requirements of the story.
