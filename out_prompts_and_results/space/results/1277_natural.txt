Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to teleport back to the spaceship for safety. The Lizard, understanding Zoe's intentions and wanting to maintain their friendship, does not get angry this time. Once aboard the spaceship, Zoe can monitor the situation and ensure both she and the Lizard remain safe. After a while, Zoe can return to the surface when it is safe, and they can continue to build their friendship.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to achieve her goal of being safe, as the surface is dangerous due to the eruption.
2. **The Lizard does not get angry.** - This is implied as part of their friendship; the Lizard understands Zoe's need for safety.
3. **Zoe waits on the spaceship until the surface is safe.** - This action is necessary to ensure that both characters remain healthy and safe.
4. **Zoe teleports back to the surface when it is safe.** - This action allows Zoe to return to the planet and continue her exploration and friendship with the Lizard.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also maintaining her friendship with the Lizard.
