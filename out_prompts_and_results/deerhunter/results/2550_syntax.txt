To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This is necessary because he needs a loaded gun to threaten the bank clerk or to hunt Bambi.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals the money from the bank clerk while threatening him with the loaded rifle. This action directly leads to Bubba obtaining the money.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba leaves the bank and goes to the forest. This is necessary for him to potentially encounter Bambi.

4. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba shoots Bambi in the forest. This action ensures that Bambi is dead, fulfilling one of the conditions of the ending.

5. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba eats Bambi. This action is not strictly necessary for the ending but aligns with Bubba's hunger and completes the narrative.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Loading the rifle** is essential for Bubba to have the means to intimidate the clerk or hunt Bambi.
