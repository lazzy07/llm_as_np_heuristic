To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant moves from the Camp to the Crossroads to be in a position to interact with Tom, who is at the Crossroads.

2. **buy(Merchant, Medicine, TomCoin, Crossroads)**: The Merchant buys the medicine from Tom using one of the coins she has. This action allows the Merchant to gain an item of value while also ensuring she has made a legitimate transaction, thus avoiding criminality.

3. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant then walks back to the Market, where she can potentially sell the medicine or use it to further her business.

This sequence of actions allows the Merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring coins without engaging in criminal activity, as she has made a legitimate purchase.
