Tom, armed with the merchant's sword and carrying the medicine, stands at the crossroads. He sees the bandit, who is also armed, and realizes that he needs to get back to the cottage safely with the medicine. 

To achieve his goal, Tom decides to report the bandit to the guard, who is at the market. This action is strategic because it will alert the guard to the presence of a criminal, potentially leading to the bandit's capture or elimination.
