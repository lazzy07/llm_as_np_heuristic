In this story, the Merchant's goal is to acquire as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal. Given the current situation, the Merchant can take advantage of the chaos caused by the Bandit attacking Tom. 

Here's the sequence of actions:

1. **loot(Merchant, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Merchant can loot the coin from Tom's corpse after the Bandit has attacked him. This action allows the Merchant to gain a coin without committing a crime, as Tom is already dead and the Merchant is not attacking anyone.

This single action achieves the Merchant's goal of acquiring coins while remaining a lawful character.
