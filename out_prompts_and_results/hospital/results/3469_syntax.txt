To ensure that all patients are healthy, Hathaway must assess and treat each patient based on their symptoms. Since Jones is already in Exam Room A, Hathaway will assess Jones first. After assessing, Hathaway will treat Jones based on the symptoms observed. Then, Hathaway will admit Ross and Young to Exam Room B and Exam Room C, respectively, and assess and treat them as well. 

Hereâ€™s the complete story:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis.
2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway treats Jones with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial for Jones to become healthy.
3. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: Hathaway admits Ross to Exam Room B to ensure he can be assessed and treated next.
4. **Admit Young to Exam Room C**: Hathaway admits Young to Exam Room C to ensure he can also be assessed and treated.
5. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms.

7. **Assess Young**: Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms.
