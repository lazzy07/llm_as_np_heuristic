To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to reach his desired location, the cottage.

2. **Tom uses the medicine.**  
   - This action is included to signify that Tom has successfully completed his goal of carrying the medicine to the cottage.

The story is very straightforward, as Tom only needs to walk to the cottage with the medicine he has already acquired. The other characters do not interfere with Tom's goal, and since he is not a criminal, he can safely walk to the cottage without any threat.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.",
    "Tom uses the medicine."
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Tom achieves his goal efficiently and without unnecessary complications.
