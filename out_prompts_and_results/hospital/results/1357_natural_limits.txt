Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to treat Jones, who is currently in Patient Room A and is experiencing a fever. Since Jones has a fever, he is suffering from Flaze, which requires antibiotics for treatment. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.** This action is necessary because it directly addresses Jones's symptoms and aims to make him healthy. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 2, he can treat Jones without making a mistake.

After treating Jones, he becomes healthy. 

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B.** This action is taken to ensure that Ross, who is still in the admissions room, can be assessed and treated next. 

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms. Since Ross's symptoms are unknown, this assessment is crucial for his treatment.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.** Assuming Ross has a rash (which is a possibility since his symptoms were unknown), Dr. Hathaway treats him with steroids. This action is taken to ensure Ross's health as well.

At this point, both Jones and Ross are healthy, fulfilling Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.

**Final Explanation of Actions:**
- Treating Jones was essential to address his fever and ensure he becomes healthy.
- Admitting Ross allows for the next patient to be processed and treated.
- Assessing Ross is crucial to identify his symptoms and provide the correct treatment.
- Treating Ross ensures he also becomes healthy, contributing to Dr. Hathaway's goal.
