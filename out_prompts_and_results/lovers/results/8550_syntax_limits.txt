In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the item I3 (the item currently held by Casey). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake achieving their goal:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I3, R22)**: Blake (C3) trades the jewelry (I1) they have for the flowers (I3) that Casey (C2) is holding in the living room (R22). This action is necessary because it allows Blake to give Alex the item they want (I3), which will make Alex happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be happy because they now have the flowers (I3).
- Blake will also be happy because they successfully helped Alex achieve happiness.

### Explanation of the Action:
