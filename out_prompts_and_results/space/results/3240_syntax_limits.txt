Zoe, now on the surface of the planet, realizes that the volcano has begun to erupt, making the environment increasingly dangerous. She knows that she needs to ensure both her safety and the safety of the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Since they have already made peace, Zoe decides to take action to help both of them.

To achieve her goal of being healthy and safe while also making friends with the Lizard, Zoe teleports back to the spaceship. This action is necessary because the surface is dangerous due to the erupting volcano, and by returning to the ship, she can ensure her safety. The Lizard, having made peace with Zoe, understands her need to be safe and does not become angry.
