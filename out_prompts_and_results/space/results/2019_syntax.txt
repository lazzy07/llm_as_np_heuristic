To complete the story, Zoe needs to ensure her safety and establish a friendship with the Lizard. Given the current situation, the best course of action is to make peace with the Lizard and then teleport back to the spaceship to ensure her safety.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe and the Lizard are already in a non-fighting state, and they have a positive relationship. This action solidifies their friendship, which is one of Zoe's goals.

2. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: After making peace, Zoe teleports back to the spaceship. This ensures her safety, as the surface is dangerous.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **make_peace**: This action is crucial because it helps Zoe achieve her goal of making friends with the Lizard. Since they are already in a non-fighting state and have a positive relationship, this action reinforces their bond and ensures that they are allies.

- **teleport_to_ship**: This action is necessary for Zoe to achieve her goal of being safe. The surface is dangerous, and by teleporting back to the spaceship, she removes herself from any potential threats, including the risk of a volcanic eruption.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)",
    "teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)"
  ]
}
