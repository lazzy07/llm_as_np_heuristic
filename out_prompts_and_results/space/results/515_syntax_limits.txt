Zoe, having just arrived at the cave, realizes that the Lizard is still on the surface and in danger due to the erupting volcano. She decides to make peace with the Lizard to ensure both of them can work together for their safety. 

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to be friends, emphasizing the need for cooperation in the face of the volcano's threat. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.

2. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: As they are making peace, the volcano begins to erupt, creating a sense of urgency. This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of the volcano erupting in the story.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, and since the Lizard is still on the surface, it results in the Lizard's demise. This action concludes the story with a character dying, fulfilling the requirement of the ending.

In summary, the actions taken ensure that Zoe and the Lizard become friends while also leading to the eruption of the volcano, which ultimately results in the Lizard's death.
