**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, first treats Jones in Patient Room A. Since Jones is experiencing Fever, Hathaway administers antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This successfully makes Jones healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway realizes that Ross is still in the admissions room and has not been assessed yet. With a workload of 2, Hathaway can still assess Ross without making a mistake. Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess Ross. Upon assessment, Hathaway discovers that Ross is also experiencing Fever. Hathaway then admits Ross to Patient Room B and treats him with antibiotics, successfully making Ross healthy as well.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to Patient Room C to assess Young. Young's symptoms are still unknown, but Hathaway can treat Young with steroids as a precaution, assuming it might be Jarkis. However, since Young is not showing any symptoms, this treatment does not harm him, and he remains healthy.

With both Jones and Ross treated successfully, and Young remaining healthy, Dr. Hathaway achieves the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.

5. **Treat Ross with antibiotics**: Since Ross also has Fever, treating him with antibiotics ensures he becomes healthy.
6. **Return to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway needs to check on Young to ensure he is also healthy.
7. **Assess Young**: This is necessary to determine Young's condition and ensure he receives appropriate care.
