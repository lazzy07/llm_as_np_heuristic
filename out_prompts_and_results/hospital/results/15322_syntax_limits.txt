**Story Completion:**

After admitting Ross to Exam Room A and Young to Exam Room C, Hathaway walks to Exam Room A to assess Ross. 

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment plan. 

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway determines that he has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This action ensures that Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Hathaway then walks back to the Admissions room to assess Jones, who is still waiting. This is important to ensure that all patients are attended to and that Jones receives the necessary care.

By taking these actions, Hathaway successfully treats Ross, ensuring he is healthy, which aligns with Hathaway's goal of having all hospital patients healthy.
