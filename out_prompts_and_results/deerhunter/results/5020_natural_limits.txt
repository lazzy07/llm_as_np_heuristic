Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting to have money, decides to take action. He looks at the bank clerk, who has 1 money. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can use it to achieve his goal. 

Bubba points the rifle at the clerk and demands the money. The clerk, believing Bubba is alive and armed, hands over the 1 money to Bubba to avoid confrontation. Bubba now has the money he wanted.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Bubba shoots the clerk**: This action is not included because it would not help Bubba achieve his goal of obtaining money without unnecessary violence. Instead, he uses intimidation.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This action is implied when Bubba demands the money, and the clerk willingly gives it to him out of fear.

The story is complete with just one action that leads to Bubba achieving his goal of having 1 money.
