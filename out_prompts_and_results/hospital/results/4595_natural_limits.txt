Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to treat Jones, who is currently in Patient Room A and is experiencing Fever. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 2, they can safely treat Jones without making a mistake.

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.** This action is necessary because Jones has a fever, which is a symptom of Flaze. By treating him with antibiotics, Jones will become healthy.

After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 1, and Jones is now healthy. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway needs to address Ross, who is still in the admissions room and has an unknown condition. Since Dr. Hathaway is unaware of Ross's symptoms, they will admit Ross to an exam room to assess him.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to ensure that Ross can be assessed and treated if needed.

Now, Dr. Hathaway can assess Ross to determine his condition.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross.** This action is necessary to find out what symptoms Ross is experiencing. 

Assuming Ross is found to have an unknown condition that is not Flaze or Jarkis, Dr. Hathaway will not be able to treat him correctly. However, since the goal is to ensure all patients are healthy, Dr. Hathaway will focus on the patients they can help.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway will check on Young, who is in Patient Room C.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young.** This action is necessary to determine Young's condition and ensure he is healthy as well.

In this scenario, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Jones, admits Ross for assessment, and checks on Young, ensuring that at least one patient is healthy and that they are working towards the goal of having all patients healthy.
