To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The current situation is that Bubba is at the bank, and the clerk is also at the bank with 1 money. Bubba has 0 money and wants to have 1 money. The clerk believes that Bambi is alive, which may influence their actions.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal from the clerk, who has 1 money. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money.

2. **Bubba goes from the bank to the house.** After stealing the money, Bubba can leave the bank. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal but helps to conclude the story by moving Bubba away from the scene.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Steal the money from the clerk:** This action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money, as he takes the clerk's only money.
- **Go to the house:** This action is a transition that signifies Bubba's departure from the bank after achieving his goal.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.",
    "Bubba goes from the bank to the house."
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba successfully achieves his goal of having 1 money while adhering to the constraints of the story.
