To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant moves from the Camp to the Crossroads to be in a position to interact with the Bandit, who is currently at the Crossroads.

2. **rob(Merchant, BanditCoin, Bandit, Crossroads)**: The Merchant, armed with a sword, robs the Bandit, taking the BanditCoin. This action is necessary for the Merchant to increase her coin count without becoming a criminal, as the Bandit is a criminal and can be robbed.

3. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Merchant returns to the Camp with the stolen BanditCoin.

4. **take(Merchant, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Merchant places the BanditCoin into the chest at the Camp, ensuring that she has successfully secured the coins without being labeled a criminal.

At this point, the Merchant has achieved her goal of acquiring more coins without breaking the law.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Walking to Crossroads**: This action positions the Merchant to interact with the Bandit, who is a target for robbery.
- **Robbing the Bandit**: This is a crucial action that allows the Merchant to gain coins without committing a crime, as the Bandit is already a criminal.
- **Walking back to Camp**: This action is necessary to return to a safe location where the Merchant can store her coins.
- **Taking the BanditCoin to the Chest**: This final action secures the coins in a safe place, ensuring the Merchant's goal is met.
