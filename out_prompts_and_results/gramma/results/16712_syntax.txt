To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit is already at the Market, so she will walk to the Crossroads to be in a position to interact with Tom and the Merchant.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant, who is carrying Tom's coin. Since the Merchant is armed, this action is not possible. Therefore, the Bandit will instead attempt to rob Tom, who is unarmed and carrying the Medicine. This action will allow the Bandit to take the Medicine from Tom.

3. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Bandit Camp to secure her coins in the chest.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

The Bandit successfully robs Tom and secures her coins, fulfilling her objective.
