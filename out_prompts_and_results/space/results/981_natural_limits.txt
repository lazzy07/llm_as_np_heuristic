Zoe, realizing that the surface is too dangerous due to the erupting volcano, decides to make peace with the Lizard, hoping to establish a friendship that could help both of them. The Lizard, seeing Zoe's willingness to communicate rather than fight, agrees to make peace. They both understand that they share a common goal of safety and health, and this newfound friendship allows them to work together.

However, as they are making peace, the volcano on the surface suddenly erupts, causing chaos. The eruption is powerful, and despite their efforts to befriend each other, the Lizard is caught in the eruption and dies.
