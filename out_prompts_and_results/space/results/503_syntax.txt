To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The actions taken will lead to this outcome while adhering to the established relationships and goals of the characters.

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano starts to erupt, making the surface dangerous. This action is necessary to set the stage for the impending danger that will lead to a character's demise.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave to seek shelter from the eruption. This action is taken to avoid the immediate danger of the volcano while also allowing her to interact with the Lizard.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave. This action is necessary for both characters to be in the same location, which is essential for them to interact and potentially become friends.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe and the Lizard make peace in the cave. This action solidifies their friendship, as they are no longer fighting and are working towards mutual safety.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, causing destruction on the surface. Since both characters are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption, but the action signifies the danger that was present.

6. **kill(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action is not applicable since both characters are safe in the cave. Instead, we can conclude that the Lizard, while trying to protect Zoe, sacrifices itself to save her from the eruption, leading to the Lizard's death.

The final story sequence leads to the Lizard dying while ensuring that Zoe and the Lizard become friends. The Lizard's sacrifice highlights the theme of friendship and mutual safety.
