To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R12) where the flowers (I1) are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the flowers to pick them up.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R12)**: Alex picks up the flowers (I1) in the dining room (R12). This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they want.

3. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to maintain the flow of the story and allows for potential interactions with other characters.

4. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the living room (R22) from the dining room (R12). This action allows Casey to be in the same room as Alex, which may lead to further interactions.

5. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R12) from the living room (R22). This action allows Blake to be in the same room as the flowers, which may lead to a potential trade or interaction.

6. **give(C1, I1, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the flowers (I1) to Casey in the living room (R22). This action is included to ensure that Casey is happy, as Casey wants the flowers.

7. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves back to the dining room (R12) to be with the flowers.

8. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Alex and Casey.

At this point, Alex has the flowers, which makes them happy. The story ends with Alex achieving their goal.
