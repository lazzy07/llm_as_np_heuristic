To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Since Ross is currently in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room, Hathaway should assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to understand what treatment he may need.

2. **Walk Ross to Exam Room B**: After assessing Ross, if he shows symptoms of Jarkis (the rash), Hathaway can then admit him to Exam Room B, where he can be treated.

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Similarly, Hathaway should assess Young, who is also in the admissions room, to determine his symptoms.

4. **Walk Young to Exam Room C**: If Young shows symptoms of Flaze (the fever), Hathaway can then admit him to Exam Room C for treatment.

5. **Treat Ross in Exam Room B**: If Ross is diagnosed with Jarkis, Hathaway should treat him with steroids in Exam Room B.

6. **Treat Young in Exam Room C**: If Young is diagnosed with Flaze, Hathaway should treat him with antibiotics in Exam Room C.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that both Ross and Young receive the appropriate treatments for their respective diseases, leading to their recovery.

Here’s the complete sequence of actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms and decide on the treatment.
2. **Walk Ross to Exam Room B**: This action is necessary to move Ross to a treatment area after assessment.
3. **Assess Young**: This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and decide on the treatment.
4. **Walk Young to Exam Room C**: This action is necessary to move Young to a treatment area after assessment.
5. **Treat Ross**: This action is necessary to provide the correct treatment for Ross's condition.
6. **Treat Young**: This action is necessary to provide the correct treatment for Young's condition.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, Admissions)",
    "walk(Ross, Admissions, ExamRoomB)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, Admissions)",
    "walk(Young, Admissions, ExamRoomC)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, ExamRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, antibiotics, ExamRoomC)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Hathaway successfully treats both patients, achieving the goal of making them healthy.
