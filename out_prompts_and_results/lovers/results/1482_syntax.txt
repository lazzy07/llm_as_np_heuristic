To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex obtains the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **tell(C2, C1, I2, R22)**: Blake tells Alex that Casey wants the chocolates (I2). This is a lie, as Casey actually wants the jewelry (I3). However, this misinformation may lead Alex to think that Blake is trying to help Casey, which could motivate Alex to act.

2. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) to check for the chocolates (I2) that Blake mentioned.

3. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: In the dining room, Alex picks up the flowers (I1), which is the item they actually want.

4. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex returns to the living room (R22) with the flowers.

5. **give(C1, I1, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the flowers (I1) to Casey, making Casey happy.

6. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R21) to check on the situation.

7. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Blake picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room.

8. **give(C2, I2, C1, R21)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex, making Alex happy.

Now, Alex is happy because they have the flowers, and Casey is also happy because they received the flowers. Blake is happy because they helped both Alex and Casey.
