To complete the story, Zoe needs to ensure her safety and health while also making friends with the Lizard. Since they are already on friendly terms, the next step is to ensure they both feel safe on the surface of the planet. Given the dangerous status of the surface, Zoe should take action to address this.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: Zoe decides to start the eruption of the volcano on the surface. This action is taken to create a sense of urgency and to prompt both characters to move to a safer location, as the surface is currently dangerous.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary to ensure both characters are in the same safe location.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard also walks to the cave, following Zoe. This action is important for both characters to be together in a safe environment.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once both characters are in the cave, Zoe makes peace with the Lizard again. This action solidifies their friendship and ensures that they both feel safe and healthy together.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making friends with the Lizard.
