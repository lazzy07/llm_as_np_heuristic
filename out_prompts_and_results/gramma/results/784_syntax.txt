To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **Rob Tom**: The bandit will rob Tom to take the medicine he is carrying. This action is necessary because the bandit needs to eliminate Tom as a threat and gain an item that could be valuable or useful.

2. **Report Bandit to Guard**: Tom will report the bandit to the guard. This action is included to create a scenario where the guard is alerted to the bandit's presence, which will lead to a confrontation.

3. **Attack Bandit**: The guard will attack the bandit. This action is necessary to eliminate the bandit as a threat and to fulfill the guard's goal of killing criminals.

4. **Loot Bandit**: Tom will loot the bandit’s corpse to take the bandit’s sword. This action is included to ensure that Tom can defend himself in the future and to gain an item that could help him.

5. **Take BanditCoin from Chest**: The bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action is necessary for the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

The story unfolds as follows:

- The bandit, seeing Tom in the market, decides to rob him. She successfully takes the medicine from Tom.
- Tom, realizing he has been robbed, reports the bandit to the guard.
- The guard, upon hearing the report, attacks the bandit, killing her.
- Tom, now armed with the bandit's sword, loots her body for any items she may have had.
- Meanwhile, the bandit, despite being dead, had previously stored coins in her chest at the bandit camp. In a twist of fate, she is able to take the coins from the chest, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

This sequence of actions ensures that the bandit achieves her goal, even after her demise.
