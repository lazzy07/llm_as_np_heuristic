To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank and wants to have money, while the clerk has the money. Bubba is also hungry, which may influence his actions.

Here’s a concise sequence of actions that leads to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to steal**: Since Bubba has a rifle and ammunition, he can threaten the clerk to steal the money. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This action directly fulfills Bubba's desire to have money.
3. **Bubba decides to eat**: After stealing the money, Bubba can satisfy his hunger by eating. This action is not necessary for achieving the goal but adds depth to Bubba's character.

Now, let’s explain why each action is included:

- **Bubba decides to steal**: This action is crucial because it allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk without needing to shoot him, which would complicate the story unnecessarily.
- **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This action directly results in Bubba having the money, fulfilling one of the story's goals.
- **Bubba decides to eat**: While this action does not contribute to the primary goal of acquiring money, it reflects Bubba's hunger and adds a layer of realism to his character's motivations.

The final outcome is that Bubba has the money, and Bambi remains alive, which satisfies the requirement of the story.
