To achieve Alex's goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Casey picks up the flowers in the bathroom.**  
   - This action is necessary because Casey currently has the flowers in the bathroom, and Alex wants them. By picking them up, Casey can then give them to Alex.

2. **Casey gives the flowers to Alex.**  
   - This action allows Casey to fulfill Alex's desire for the flowers, which is essential for Alex's happiness.

3. **Blake moves from the bathroom to the dining room.**  
   - This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's goal but helps Blake to find the chocolates, which is his desire. It also keeps the story flowing as Blake seeks his own happiness.

4. **Blake picks up the chocolates in the dining room.**  
   - This action allows Blake to achieve his goal of happiness by obtaining the chocolates.

5. **Blake moves back to the bathroom.**  
   - This action is to return to the bathroom where Alex and Casey are, maintaining the connection between the characters.

At this point, Alex has the flowers and is happy. Blake has the chocolates and is happy. Casey is not happy because she still wants the jewelry, but the story focuses on Alex achieving their goal.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:
