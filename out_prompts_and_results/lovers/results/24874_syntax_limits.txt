In the current situation, Casey wants the jewelry (I3) to be happy. Since Casey is currently in the same room as Alex and Blake, and Alex has the jewelry, Casey can simply ask Alex for it.

**Action:**
1. **give(C3, I3, C1, R22)** - Casey gives the jewelry to Alex in the dining room.

**Explanation:**
- This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the item they want (jewelry) directly from Alex, who currently has it. By doing this, Casey achieves their goal of being happy.

After this action, the situation will be:
- at(C1) = R22; at(C2) = R22; at(C3) = R22; at(I1) = R22; at(I2) = R21; at(I3) = C1; happy(C1) = False; happy(C2) = False; happy(C3) = True; wants(C1) = I1; wants(C2) = I2; wants(C3) = I3; 

Casey is now happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.
