Ernest, realizing that he is threatened by the bully in the locked gym, decides to take decisive action. He knows he has the knife and the element of surprise on his side. 

**Action:** Ernest uses the knife to kill the bully.

**Explanation:** This action is necessary for Ernest to eliminate the threat posed by the bully, ensuring both his and Roy's safety. By killing the bully, Ernest can secure the gym and prevent any further threats, allowing him to keep the cigarettes and the clothes he has stolen. 

After killing the bully, Ernest can then unlock the gym door and escape with Roy, but since the goal is for Ernest to be alive and have a pack of cigarettes, this single action suffices to achieve that goal.
