Zoe stands on the surface, aware of the imminent danger from the erupting volcano. She knows she needs to make a connection with the Lizard to ensure both their safety. 

1. **Zoe walks towards the Lizard.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to initiate a conversation and establish a relationship with the Lizard, as they are currently not fighting and can communicate.

2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** - By making peace, Zoe and the Lizard can become friends, which aligns with both of their goals of wanting to make friends and be safe. 

3. **The volcano erupts.** - This event occurs as a consequence of the story's setting, and it leads to the climax where one character must face the consequences of being on the surface.

4. **Zoe is killed by the eruption.** - This action concludes the story with Zoe's death, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying due to the eruption.

The sequence of actions leads to the desired ending where Zoe dies in the eruption, while also establishing a friendship with the Lizard before the tragic event. The Lizard, now a friend of Zoe, is left to reflect on the importance of connection and safety.
