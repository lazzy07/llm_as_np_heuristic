To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and has just stolen a rifle from the bank clerk. He has already shot Bambi, which means he can now eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. After eating, he can return to the bank to steal money from the clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba will eat Bambi, which satisfies his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will help him regain energy and focus on his next goal.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go back to the bank. This action is necessary to return to the location where he can confront the bank clerk and steal money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will steal from the bank clerk again, using the rifle he has. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to regain energy.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank to confront the clerk.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Allows Bubba to take money from the clerk, achieving his goal.
