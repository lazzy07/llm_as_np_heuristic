To achieve Rory's goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the story can be completed with the following action:

1. **Vince proposes to Talia.** 

This action is necessary because it allows Rory to achieve happiness through the marriage of Talia and Vince.

After this action, the story concludes with Rory being happy due to the relationships formed, and he remains wealthy and not hungry.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **Vince proposes to Talia:** This action is taken to create a new dynamic in the relationships. By proposing, Vince can potentially create a situation where Talia's happiness increases, which in turn can reflect positively on Rory's happiness as they are all interconnected in their relationships.
