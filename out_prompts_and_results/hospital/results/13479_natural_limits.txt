Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Ross is experiencing an unknown condition, Hathaway must make a decision based on the information available. Given that Ross is in Patient Room A, Hathaway treats him for Flaze, believing that the fever is a possibility. This treatment is incorrect, but since Hathaway's workload is 2, he does not make a mistake. Ross, however, does not have Flaze and dies as a result of the incorrect treatment.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Jones. He admits Jones to Patient Room B, where he can be treated. Hathaway then assesses Jones, who is also experiencing an unknown condition. Hathaway treats Jones for Jarkis, which is the correct treatment since Jones is healthy and alive.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions again to admit Young to Patient Room C. He assesses Young, who is experiencing an unknown condition, and treats him for Jarkis as well, which is the correct treatment. Young becomes healthy.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Jones and Young, achieving his goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy, despite the unfortunate outcome for Ross.
