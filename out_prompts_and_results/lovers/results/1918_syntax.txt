To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **trade(C2, I1, C3, I2, R22)**: Blake (C2) will trade the jewelry (I1) they have with Casey (C3) for the chocolates (I2). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to eventually get the jewelry they want, as Casey is currently holding the chocolates, which Blake wants.

2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: After the trade, Blake will give the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1). This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

3. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey will move to the dining room (R21) to pick up the chocolates (I2) that they want. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps Casey achieve their own happiness.

4. **pick_up(C3, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room. This action ensures that Casey is also working towards their own happiness.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex (C1) will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Blake (C2) will have the chocolates (I2) and will be happy.
- Casey (C3) will have the chocolates (I2) and will be happy.

Thus, all characters will achieve their goals, but the focus is on Alex's happiness.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

    "trade(C2, I1, C3, I2, R22)",

    "move(C3, R22, R21)",
    "pick_up(C3, I2, R21)"
  ]
}
``` 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **trade**: This action allows Blake to give away the jewelry to Casey in exchange for the chocolates, which is necessary for Alex to eventually receive the jewelry.
