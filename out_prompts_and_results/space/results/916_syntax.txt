To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. Here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the surface**: This action is necessary to allow Zoe to interact with the Lizard on the surface, where the volcano is located. 

2. **Zoe walks to the Lizard**: This action brings Zoe closer to the Lizard, allowing for potential interaction and the opportunity to make peace.

3. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard**: This action is crucial as it allows Zoe and the Lizard to become friends, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.

4. **The volcano erupts**: This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of the volcano erupting, which will lead to a character dying.

5. **The Lizard dies due to the eruption**: Since the Lizard is on the surface when the volcano erupts, it results in the Lizard's death.

The sequence of actions ensures that both characters achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also making friends, even though the Lizard ultimately dies due to the eruption.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)",
    "walk(Zoe, Surface, Lizard)",
    "make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)",
    "erupt(Surface)"
  ]
}
``` 

### Explanation of Actions:
