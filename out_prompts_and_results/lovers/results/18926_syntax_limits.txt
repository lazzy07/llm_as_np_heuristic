In this story, we want to ensure that Casey achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). 

Given the current situation, here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **Action: trade(C3, I1, C2, I3, R11)** - Casey (C3) trades the flowers (I1) they have with Alex (C2) for the jewelry (I3) that Alex has. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the item they want, thus making them happy.

After this action, the situation changes as follows:
- Casey now has the jewelry (I3), which fulfills their desire and makes them happy.
- Alex gives away the jewelry but receives flowers in return, which does not affect their happiness since they are not currently seeking flowers.

Now, all characters' happiness states are:
- happy(C1) = False (Alex does not have the item they want)
- happy(C2) = False (Blake does not have the item they want)
- happy(C3) = True (Casey has the jewelry they wanted)

Thus, Casey achieves their goal of happiness.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C3, I1, C2, I3, R11)"]
}
``` 

This plan is concise and directly leads to Casey's happiness by obtaining the jewelry they desire.
