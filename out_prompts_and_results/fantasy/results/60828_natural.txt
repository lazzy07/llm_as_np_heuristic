To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Rory picks up the treasure at the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary because the treasure is at the cave, and picking it up will contribute to Rory's wealth.

2. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Rory needs to travel to the village to meet Vince, who has the money. This is essential for Rory to become wealthy.

3. **Rory takes the money from Vince's dead body.**  
   - Since Rory needs to be wealthy, taking the money from Vince (who is dead) will fulfill this requirement. This action is necessary for Rory to achieve their goal.

4. **Rory becomes hungry.**  
   - This action is included to reflect Rory's state, but it does not directly affect the goal since Rory's primary focus is on wealth and happiness.

5. **Gargax eats Rory.**  
   - This action is included to conclude the story, as it leads to Rory's death. However, it is important to note that Rory's happiness is achieved through the actions taken prior to this event.

In summary, Rory's actions lead to the acquisition of wealth through the treasure and money, fulfilling their goal of being wealthy. The final action of being eaten by Gargax serves as a narrative conclusion but does not detract from Rory's earlier achievements.
