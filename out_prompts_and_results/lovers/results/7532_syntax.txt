To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the chocolates (I2). The current situation indicates that I2 is in the bathroom (R12), and Blake is currently in the living room (R22). 

Hereâ€™s the shortest story to achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the bathroom to pick up the chocolates.
   - This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the chocolates to pick them up.

2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the chocolates from the bathroom.
   - This action is necessary for Casey to obtain the item that Blake wants.

3. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room with the chocolates.
   - This action is necessary to bring the chocolates to Blake.

4. **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates to Blake.
   - This action is necessary for Blake to receive the item they want, thus making Blake happy.

After these actions, Blake will have the chocolates, achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey needs to go to the bathroom to access the chocolates.
- **pick_up(C3, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the chocolates, which is the item Blake wants.
- **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey returns to the living room to give the chocolates to Blake.
- **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: This final action ensures that Blake receives the chocolates, making Blake happy.
