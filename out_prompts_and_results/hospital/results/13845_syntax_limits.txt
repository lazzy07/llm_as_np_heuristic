In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, needs to assess and treat the patients to ensure they are healthy. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake if they assess or treat too many patients. Therefore, the best course of action is to focus on one patient at a time.

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Hathaway walks to Exam Room B to assess Young. This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and decide on the appropriate treatment. Since Young is the only patient in Exam Room B, this will help Hathaway manage their workload effectively.

2. **Treat Young with Steroids**: After assessing Young, Hathaway finds that Young has a rash, indicating Jarkis. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This action is crucial as it directly contributes to Young's health.

3. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway then walks to Exam Room A to assess Ross. This is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms and decide on the appropriate treatment. 

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that at least two patients are treated correctly, thus achieving their goal of having all patients healthy.
