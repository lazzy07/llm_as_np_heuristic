To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to focus on getting Casey the item they want, which is the chocolates (I2). Since Casey is currently unhappy and in the same room as Alex, who is happy with the jewelry (I1), we can facilitate a trade between Alex and Casey.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves from the dining room (R22) to the living room (R12) to be closer to Alex, who has the jewelry (I1).
   - This action is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex.

2. **trade(C1, I1, C2, I2, R12)**: Alex trades the jewelry (I1) they have for the chocolates (I2) that Casey wants.
   - This action is crucial as it allows Casey to obtain the item they desire, thus making them happy.

3. **put_down(C2, I2, R12)**: Casey puts down the chocolates (I2) in the living room (R12).
   - This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but can be included to show that Casey has the chocolates.

4. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Blake moves from the living room (R12) to the dining room (R22).
   - This action is included to show that Blake is still active in the story, but it does not affect Casey's happiness.

After these actions, Casey will have the chocolates (I2) and will be happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to trade.
- **trade(C1, I1, C2, I2, R12)**: This is the key action that allows Casey to get the item they want, fulfilling their goal of happiness.
- **put_down(C2, I2, R12)**: While not necessary for happiness, it shows that Casey has the chocolates.
- **move(C3, R12, R22)**: This action keeps Blake in the story but does not impact the outcome for Casey.
