To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room B to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because Young's symptoms are currently unknown, and Hathaway needs to know if Young has Flaze or Jarkis to treat them correctly.

2. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment. If Young has Flaze, Hathaway will administer antibiotics; if Young has Jarkis, Hathaway will administer steroids. This action is crucial to ensure Young becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Jones**: After treating Young, Hathaway will assess Jones in the Admissions room. This is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms, as they are currently unknown.

4. **Treat Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment. This will ensure that Jones also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to treat all patients and achieve their goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.
