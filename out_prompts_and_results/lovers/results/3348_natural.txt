To achieve Blake's goal of obtaining the chocolates, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake tells Casey that the chocolates are in the bathroom.**  
   - This action is necessary because it misleads Casey into thinking the chocolates are in the bathroom, which will prompt her to move there and leave the living room.

2. **Casey moves from the living room to the bathroom.**  
   - Casey believes Blake's statement and moves to the bathroom, leaving the living room and the flowers behind.

3. **Blake picks up the chocolates in the living room.**  
   - With Casey now in the bathroom, Blake can safely pick up the chocolates that were in the living room.

4. **Blake moves from the living room to the bathroom.**  
   - Blake moves to the bathroom to be with Casey and to present the chocolates to her.

5. **Blake gives the chocolates to Casey.**  
   - This action fulfills Blake's goal of being happy by giving Casey the chocolates, which she wanted.

Now, let's summarize the actions in the story:

1. Blake tells Casey that the chocolates are in the bathroom (to mislead Casey).
2. Casey moves from the living room to the bathroom (following Blake's misleading information).
3. Blake picks up the chocolates in the living room (now that Casey is not there).
4. Blake moves from the living room to the bathroom (to be with Casey).
5. Blake gives the chocolates to Casey (fulfilling Blake's goal of happiness).
