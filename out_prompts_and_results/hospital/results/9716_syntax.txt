To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Young is in PatientRoomA with Ross, Young can help Hathaway by assessing Ross to determine his symptoms. This is important because it allows Hathaway to make an informed decision about treatment.

2. **Assess Young**: After assessing Ross, Young can also assess themselves to determine their own symptoms. This is crucial for Hathaway to understand Young's condition and provide the correct treatment.

3. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway can treat him accordingly. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Young**: After treating Ross, Hathaway can treat Young based on the assessment results. This ensures that Young receives the correct treatment for their symptoms, allowing them to become healthy.

5. **Walk to Admissions**: After both Ross and Young are treated, Young can walk to the admissions room to check on Jones, who is still there. This action is important for Young to ensure that all patients are accounted for and healthy.

6. **Assess Jones**: Young can assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to understand if Jones needs treatment.

7. **Treat Jones**: Finally, based on the assessment of Jones, Young can ensure that Jones receives the correct treatment, allowing him to become healthy as well.

By following these steps, Young will achieve their goal of being alive and healthy, and they will also help others in the process.
