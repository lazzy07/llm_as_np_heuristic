The merchant, wanting to maximize her coins without becoming a criminal, decides to take advantage of the situation. She knows that the bandit is likely unaware of her presence and that the guard is at the market. 

1. The merchant walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp. This action is necessary because the merchant needs to confront the bandit directly to take her coins without being seen as a criminal.

2. Upon arriving at the bandit camp, the merchant uses her sword to attack the bandit, who is unaware of her presence. This action is crucial as it allows the merchant to eliminate the bandit and take her coins without any witnesses.

3. The merchant loots the bandit's corpse, taking the bandit's coins. This action fulfills the merchant's goal of acquiring more coins without becoming a criminal, as she has eliminated the bandit first.

With these actions, the merchant successfully achieves her goal of obtaining as many coins as possible without crossing the line into criminality.
