To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The current situation shows that the flowers are in the same room as Casey and Blake (R22). Since Alex is in the dining room (R12), they need to move to the living room (R22) to get the flowers. 

Hereâ€™s the action that will help Alex achieve their goal:

1. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves from the dining room to the living room where the flowers are located. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to access the flowers, which is the item they want to be happy.

After this action, Alex will be in the same room as the flowers, and since they want the flowers, they will be happy.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **move(C1, R12, R22)**: This action is essential as it allows Alex to reach the location of the flowers. Once Alex is in the living room, they can pick up the flowers and achieve their goal of happiness.
