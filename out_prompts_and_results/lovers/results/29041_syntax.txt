To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex (C1) will trade the chocolates (I3) they picked up with Casey (C3) for the jewelry (I1) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1), making them happy.
- Casey will have the chocolates (I3), which is not what they want, but it does not affect Alex's goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purpose:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: This action allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they want by trading the chocolates they have with Casey, thus achieving Alex's goal of happiness.

Now, here is the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry they desire.
