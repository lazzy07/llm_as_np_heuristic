To ensure Vince achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Vince**: This action is necessary because Gargax, the dragon, wants to be wealthy and not hungry. By eating Vince, Gargax can take the money that Vince has, which is essential for Vince to achieve his goal of wealth. 

2. **Gargax takes the money from Vince's body**: After eating Vince, Gargax can take the money that Vince had. This action is crucial for Gargax to fulfill his desire for wealth.

3. **Gargax becomes wealthy**: By taking the money from Vince, Gargax now has wealth, which satisfies Gargax's goal of being wealthy.

4. **Gargax does not care about happiness**: Since Gargax does not care about being happy, this action is implicitly satisfied by the previous actions.

In this scenario, Vince's happiness is not achieved because he is eaten, but Gargax achieves his goal of wealth and not being hungry. The story is short and direct, focusing on the actions that lead to Gargax's success.
