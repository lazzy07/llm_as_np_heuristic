To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway needs to determine the symptoms of Young, who is currently in PatientRoomA. This is crucial to identify whether Young has Flaze or Jarkis and to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Young in PatientRoomA with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with either antibiotics (if Young has Flaze) or steroids (if Young has Jarkis). This action will ensure that Young becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: After treating Young, Hathaway will assess Jones, who is still in the admissions room. This is necessary to identify Jones's symptoms and provide the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Jones in Admissions with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with either antibiotics or steroids, depending on the identified symptoms. This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy.
