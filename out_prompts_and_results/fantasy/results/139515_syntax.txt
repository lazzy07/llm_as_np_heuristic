To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will allow Rory to gain wealth and satisfy their hunger while also ensuring they are happy. 

Here's the completed story:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory is currently in the Cave and is hungry. To achieve their goal, Rory needs to return to the Village where Talia is, as she has the Money. This action is necessary for Rory to interact with Talia and gain wealth.

2. **pickup(Rory, Money, Village)**: Once Rory arrives in the Village, they can pick up the Money that Talia has. This action is essential for Rory to become wealthy.

3. **get_hungry(Rory)**: This action is not necessary for Rory's goal, as they are already hungry. However, it is included to illustrate Rory's state of hunger.

4. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Since Talia has already proposed and Rory has accepted, they can now get married. This action will make both Rory and Talia happy, fulfilling Rory's goal of happiness.

5. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Village)**: This action is not included in the final plan as it would lead to Rory's death, which contradicts the goal of achieving happiness and wealth.

The final plan focuses on Rory traveling to the Village, picking up the Money, and marrying Talia to achieve happiness. 

Hereâ€™s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json

  "plan": [
    "travel(Rory, Cave, Village)",
