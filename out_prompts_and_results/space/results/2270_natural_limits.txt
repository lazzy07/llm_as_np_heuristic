Zoe, realizing that the surface is now uninhabitable and that she cannot explore it further, decides to teleport back to the surface to confront the Lizard. She believes that the Lizard is not the guardian of the surface and wants to clarify their relationship. 

Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface, which angers the Lizard, who perceives her as a threat to the planet. However, instead of fighting, Zoe approaches the Lizard and explains her intentions of friendship and cooperation. The Lizard, initially defensive, listens to Zoe's words and realizes that they share a common goal of safety and health. 

In a moment of understanding, they both agree to make peace, recognizing that they can work together to protect the planet and each other. 

As they are making peace, the volcano on the surface begins to erupt again, creating a dangerous situation. Zoe and the Lizard, now friends, quickly teleport back to the ship together, escaping the eruption just in time.
