To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can follow a concise sequence of actions. Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.** This action is taken because Bubba is hungry and has a loaded rifle, which allows him to kill Bambi for food. This also aligns with his greed, as he may want to take the money from the bank clerk later.

2. **Bubba shoots Bambi.** This action directly results in Bambi being dead, fulfilling one of the conditions of the ending.

3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** After shooting Bambi, Bubba can eat the deer, satisfying his hunger.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba is not only fulfilling his immediate need for food but also potentially setting himself up for future actions regarding the money.

- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest):** After killing Bambi, Bubba eats the deer, which satisfies his hunger and keeps him alive.
