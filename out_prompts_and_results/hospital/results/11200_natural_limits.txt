Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room A, realizes that she needs to assess the patients in the admissions room to determine their symptoms and provide the necessary treatment. With a workload of 3, she is at risk of making a mistake, but she prioritizes the health of her patients.

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess the patients, Jones, Ross, and Young, who are currently in the admissions room.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B.**  
   - By admitting Ross to an exam room, Dr. Hathaway can later assess and treat him. This action also increases her workload to 4, but she is determined to help her patients.

3. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room C.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to manage both patients effectively. Now, she can assess and treat them in their respective rooms.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.**  
   - Since Young is now assigned to Patient Room C, Dr. Hathaway can assess him for symptoms. She discovers that Young has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. 

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis with steroids.**  
   - This action is crucial as it directly addresses Young's condition. Since she correctly identifies the disease and administers the appropriate treatment, Young becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Young, achieving her goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
