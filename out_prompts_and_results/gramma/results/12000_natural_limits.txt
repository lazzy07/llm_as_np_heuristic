The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the merchant dead and realizes that the guard is now distracted by the chaos. She quickly decides to rob the hero, who is unarmed and carrying the medicine. The bandit approaches Tom and, with a swift motion, threatens him with her sword, demanding he hand over the medicine. Tom, fearing for his life, complies and gives the medicine to the bandit. 

With the medicine in her possession, the bandit feels accomplished. She now has the means to either sell the medicine for coins or use it for her own benefit. The bandit then walks back to the bandit camp, satisfied with her haul.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. The bandit robs the hero (Tom) to take the medicine. This action is necessary for the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins or valuable items as possible.
2. The bandit then walks back to the bandit camp, which is her preferred location, ensuring she is safe and can keep her new possession.
