The bandit, having just attacked both the hero and the merchant, sees an opportunity to secure her goal of carrying as many coins as possible. She approaches the merchant's corpse and loots the medicine, which she believes will be valuable. With the merchant dead, the bandit now has the medicine and can return to the bandit camp to store her coins safely.

1. The bandit loots the medicine from the merchant's corpse. This action is necessary for the bandit to acquire an item of value, which contributes to her goal of having as many coins as possible in the chest at the bandit camp.

2. The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp. This action is essential for the bandit to transport herself and the newly acquired medicine to a location where she can secure her coins.

By completing these actions, the bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying valuable items and securing her coins.
