Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B to determine his symptoms. Since Ross is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, Hathaway's workload is still manageable, so she decides to treat Ross with antibiotics, mistakenly believing he has Flaze. This action reduces her workload by one, but unfortunately, it does not match Ross's actual condition, leading to his demise.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room C. She assigns Young to the room, increasing her workload back to two. 

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C. Young is also experiencing Unknown, but Hathaway correctly identifies the symptoms as Jarkis and treats him with steroids, successfully curing him.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway has treated one patient correctly, ensuring that at least one patient is healthy, which aligns with her goal of having all hospital patients healthy.
