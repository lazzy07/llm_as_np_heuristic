Zoe, the space explorer, is determined to make friends with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. To achieve her goal of being healthy and safe while fostering friendship, she needs to approach the Lizard in a non-threatening manner.

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe decides to walk from the surface to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary because it allows her to approach the Lizard directly without using teleportation, which could provoke anger.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once Zoe reaches the cave, she initiates a peace-making gesture with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it directly addresses her goal of making friends with the Lizard, fostering a positive relationship.

After these actions, Zoe successfully establishes a friendship with the Lizard, ensuring both characters feel safe and healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk**: This action is chosen to avoid angering the Lizard and to create a direct, friendly approach.
