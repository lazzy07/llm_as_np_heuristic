In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy, but they are not happy yet. Casey (C3) has the jewelry, and Blake (C2) is currently holding the chocolates (I2). 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the simplest action would be for Casey to give the jewelry to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire and makes them happy.

Here’s the completed story:

1. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry to Alex in the dining room. This action makes Alex happy because they now have the item they want.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is now happy because they have the jewelry.
- Casey is not happy because they no longer have the jewelry.
- Blake remains unhappy as they still have the chocolates and do not have what they want.

This action is necessary because it directly addresses Alex's goal of achieving happiness by obtaining the jewelry.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:
