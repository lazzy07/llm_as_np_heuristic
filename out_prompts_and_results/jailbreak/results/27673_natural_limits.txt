**Story Completion:**

As the day progresses, Roy, still in the cells, realizes the danger they are in due to the bully's threats. He decides to take a risk. He sneaks out of the cells and heads to the kitchen where Ernest is. 

In the kitchen, Roy finds Ernest and quickly hands him the pack of cigarettes he stole. They both know that the bully will be furious when he finds out. They also know that they need to act fast. 

Ernest, feeling emboldened by the cigarettes, grabs the knife from the kitchen counter. He and Roy then make their way to the hallway, where they can access the vents. They crawl through the vents to the highway outside the prison, where they can put on the civilian clothes they had previously stolen. 

Once outside, they put on the civilian clothes, disguising themselves. With the disguise on, they manage to escape from the prison, leaving the threats of the bully behind.
