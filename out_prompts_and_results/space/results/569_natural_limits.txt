Zoe, realizing that the surface is now uninhabitable and wanting to understand the Lizard better, decides to teleport back to the surface despite knowing it might anger the Lizard. She believes that the Lizard is not the guardian of the surface, but she hopes to change that perception. 

Upon teleporting to the surface, the Lizard, sensing Zoe's presence, becomes furious and approaches her. Instead of fighting, Zoe quickly explains her intentions and how she wants to be friends, emphasizing that she respects the Lizard's role as the guardian. The Lizard, surprised by Zoe's willingness to communicate rather than fight, begins to see her in a new light. 

As they talk, the volcano starts to rumble ominously, indicating an imminent eruption. Zoe and the Lizard realize they must work together to escape the danger. They agree to help each other, solidifying their newfound friendship just as the volcano erupts.
