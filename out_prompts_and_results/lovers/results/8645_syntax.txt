To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the room where Casey is located (R21). This is necessary because Alex needs to interact with Casey to obtain the jewelry.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the room where they were previously (R22). This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but helps to conclude the story in a coherent manner.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R22, R21)**: This action allows Alex to reach Casey, who has the jewelry.

- **move(C1, R21, R22)**: This action is simply to return to the previous room, providing a sense of closure to the story.
