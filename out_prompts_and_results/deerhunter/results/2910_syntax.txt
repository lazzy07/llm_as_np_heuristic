To complete the story where Bubba achieves his goal of getting money, we can outline the following sequence of actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, feeling greedy and wanting money, decides to shoot the bank clerk to steal the money. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

2. **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can eat the clerk's body since he is hungry. This action is not necessary for achieving the goal of getting money but serves to satisfy Bubba's hunger.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: Bubba then goes back to the house. This action is necessary for Bubba to secure his position after committing the crime.

4. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba picks up the money from the bank after the clerk is dead. This action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.

- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk and take the money.
- **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: This action satisfies Bubba's hunger but is not directly related to his goal of obtaining money.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: This action allows Bubba to escape the scene after committing the crime.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This action is crucial for Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.
