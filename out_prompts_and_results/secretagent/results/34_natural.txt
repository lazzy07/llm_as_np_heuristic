To achieve the goal of the secret agent killing the mastermind, the following actions will be taken:

1. **The secret agent moves from the lobby to the office.**  
   - This action is necessary because the mastermind is not in the lobby, and the secret agent needs to find the mastermind to carry out the goal.

2. **The secret agent finds the mastermind in the office.**  
   - This action is implied as the secret agent needs to confront the mastermind to fulfill the objective of killing them.

3. **The secret agent kills the mastermind in the office.**
