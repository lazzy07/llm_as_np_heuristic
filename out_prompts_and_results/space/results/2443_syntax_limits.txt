Zoe, the space explorer, is currently in the cave on the planet. She knows that the Lizard is on the surface and is the guardian of the planet. To achieve her goal of making friends with the Lizard, she decides to walk to the surface where the Lizard is located. 

**Action:**
- walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)

**Explanation:**
Zoe walks from the cave to the surface to meet the Lizard. This action is necessary because it allows her to be in the same location as the Lizard, which is essential for them to interact and potentially become friends. By being on the surface, Zoe can engage with the Lizard and work towards her goal of friendship.

After walking to the surface, Zoe can initiate a conversation with the Lizard, expressing her desire to be friends and work together for their mutual safety and health.
