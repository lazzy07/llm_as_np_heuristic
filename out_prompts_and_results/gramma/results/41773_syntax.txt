To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, who is currently in the Market and does not have a sword. This action allows the Bandit to take the coin that Tom is carrying.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp to secure the stolen coin in the chest.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coin from Tom and place it in the chest at the Bandit Camp, ensuring that the Bandit has achieved her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **Walking to the Camp**: This action is essential for the Bandit to move to a safe location where she can store the stolen coin.
- **Taking the Coin to the Chest**: This final action ensures that the Bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp.
