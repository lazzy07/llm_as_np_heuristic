In this story, the Bandit is currently at the Crossroads and has already attacked Tom, who is now dead. The Banditâ€™s goal is to carry as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Since the Bandit has already attacked Tom, she can now loot Tom's corpse for the coins he was carrying.

**Action:**
1. **loot(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)** - The Bandit loots Tom's corpse to take the coins he was carrying.

This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying more coins. By looting Tom, she can increase her wealth without needing to go back to the camp or engage in further conflict.
