In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the flowers (I1) to be happy, but they are not currently happy. Casey (C3) has the jewelry (I3) that Alex wants, and Blake (C2) has the chocolates (I2) that Casey wants. 

To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, the simplest action would be for Blake to give the chocolates to Casey, allowing Casey to be happy. This would then enable Casey to give the jewelry to Alex, making Alex happy as well.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **give(C2, I2, C3, R12)**: Blake gives the chocolates to Casey. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to become happy, which is part of the chain reaction needed for Alex to achieve happiness.

2. **give(C3, I3, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry to Alex. This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have received the item they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action allows Casey to become happy by receiving the chocolates, which is essential for the next step.
- The second action allows Alex to become happy by receiving the jewelry, which is what they wanted.
