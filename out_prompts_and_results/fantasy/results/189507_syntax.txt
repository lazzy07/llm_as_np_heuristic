To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items available. Talia has already proposed to Rory, who accepted, which means they are on the path to marriage. However, Talia also needs to acquire wealth, which can be achieved by obtaining the treasure in the cave.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's goal:

1. **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: Vince travels to the cave to be closer to the treasure.
   - This action is necessary because Vince needs to be in the cave to interact with the treasure.

2. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the village to be with Talia.
   - This action is necessary for Rory to be with Talia, as they are engaged and need to finalize their relationship.

3. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels to the cave to get the treasure.
   - This action is essential for Talia to reach the treasure, which is necessary for her to become wealthy.

4. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave.
   - This action allows Talia to acquire the treasure, which contributes to her wealth.

5. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Talia and Rory get married in the village.
   - This action finalizes their relationship, making both Talia and Rory happy.

After these actions, Talia will have achieved her goals of being happy (through marriage) and wealthy (by acquiring the treasure).
