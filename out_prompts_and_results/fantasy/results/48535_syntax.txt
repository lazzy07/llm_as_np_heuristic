To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on her relationship with Vince, who has already proposed to her and is currently in possession of money. Since Talia is already engaged to Vince, the best course of action is for her to travel to the cave, where Vince is located, and then for them to marry. This will make Talia happy due to the marriage, and she will also gain access to Vince's money, which will contribute to her wealth.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels from the village to the cave to be with Vince, who has money and is her fiancé. This action is necessary for Talia to reach Vince and proceed with the marriage.

2. **marry(Vince, Talia, Cave)**: Talia and Vince get married in the cave. This action is crucial because it fulfills Talia's desire to be happy, as marriage is a significant source of happiness for her.

After these actions, Talia will be happy due to her marriage to Vince, and she will also have access to his money, which contributes to her wealth.
