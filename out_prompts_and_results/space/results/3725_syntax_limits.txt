Zoe, now on the surface of the planet, realizes that the environment is dangerous and that she needs to ensure both her safety and the Lizard's. Since they have already made peace, Zoe decides to take a proactive step to ensure their safety. She begins to walk towards the cave where the Lizard resides, hoping to find a safer place away from the dangers of the surface.

**Action:**
- walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)

**Explanation:**
This action is taken because Zoe wants to be safe and healthy, and walking to the cave will provide her with a safer environment. Additionally, since the Lizard is the guardian of the planet and they have already established a friendly relationship, moving towards the cave can help solidify their friendship and ensure both characters remain safe.
