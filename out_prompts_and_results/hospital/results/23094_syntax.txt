To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in PatientRoomC to determine if they have any symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will guide the treatment.

2. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment. If Young has Flaze, they will receive antibiotics; if they have Jarkis, they will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Young to become healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Young, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess and treat the other patients, Jones and Ross, ensuring they also have the opportunity to become healthy.

4. **Admit Ross**: Hathaway will admit Ross to an exam room (either A or B) to begin the process of assessment and treatment for Ross.

5. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine their symptoms, which will inform the treatment.

6. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment to ensure they also become healthy.

7. **Walk to Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will walk back to the Admissions room to check on Jones and ensure they receive the necessary care.

This sequence of actions ensures that Young is treated first, achieving their goal of being alive and healthy, while also allowing for the possibility of treating the other patients.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, PatientRoomC)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, ?, PatientRoomC)",
    "walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomC, Admissions)",
    "admit(Hathaway, Ross, PatientRoomA)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, PatientRoomA)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, ?, PatientRoomA)",
    "walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomA, Admissions)"
  ]
}
``` 

In this plan, the actions are structured to first ensure Young's health, followed by the necessary steps to address the health of the other patients, maintaining the focus on achieving health for all involved.
