**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to first assess Ross in Patient Room C. 

1. **Assess Ross in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is experiencing an unknown condition. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis (the rash disease) instead of Flaze (the fever disease). 

2. **Treat Ross in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, thinking he has Jarkis. However, since Ross actually has Flaze, he dies from the incorrect treatment.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway then walks back to the Admissions room to assess the remaining patients, Jones and Young.

4. **Admit Young to Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room A, assigning him a room for assessment.

5. **Assess Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is also experiencing an unknown condition. Again, due to her workload, she mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis.

6. **Treat Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, thinking he has Jarkis. Since Young actually has Flaze, he dies from the incorrect treatment.

7. **Walk to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room B to assess Jones.

8. **Assess Jones in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing an unknown condition. Due to her workload, she mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis.

9. **Treat Jones in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, thinking he has Jarkis. Since Jones actually has Flaze, he dies from the incorrect treatment.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway's actions lead to the deaths of Ross, Young, and Jones, but she has completed her goal of assessing and treating all patients, albeit incorrectly.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Assessing Ross, Young, and Jones was necessary to determine their conditions, even though the high workload led to mistakes.
- Treating each patient was essential to fulfill the hospital's goal of providing care, despite the incorrect treatments leading to fatal outcomes.
- Walking between rooms was necessary to facilitate the assessments and treatments of the patients.
