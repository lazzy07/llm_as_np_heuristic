Tom, armed with the merchant's sword and carrying the medicine, stands at the crossroads. He sees the bandit also at the crossroads, armed and likely to cause trouble. To ensure his safety and to achieve his goal of getting back to the cottage with the medicine, Tom decides to take decisive action.

Tom attacks the bandit with the sword, successfully killing her. This action is necessary because it eliminates the immediate threat posed by the bandit, allowing Tom to safely carry the medicine back to the cottage without fear of being robbed or attacked.

After defeating the bandit, Tom loots the bandit's corpse, but since the bandit has no coins on her, he simply takes her sword. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving his goal of returning to the cottage with the medicine, but it provides Tom with an additional weapon for future encounters.

Finally, Tom walks from the crossroads back to the cottage, successfully completing his goal of returning home with the medicine.

The story is short and direct, focusing on Tom's actions to ensure his safety and achieve his goal.
