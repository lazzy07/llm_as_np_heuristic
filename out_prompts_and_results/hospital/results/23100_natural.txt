**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to treat Jones immediately since he is showing symptoms of Fever, which indicates he has Flaze. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room A for Flaze.** 
   - This action is necessary because Jones is experiencing Fever, and the correct treatment for Flaze is antibiotics. By treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway aims to make him healthy.

After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 1. 

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C.**
   - This action is necessary to ensure that Ross, who is still in Admissions, is assigned to an exam room for further assessment and treatment.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C.**
   - This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms, as he is currently experiencing Unknown symptoms. 

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room C for Jarkis.**
   - Since Ross's symptoms were not known, Dr. Hathaway must make a decision. Assuming that Ross has Jarkis (as it is the only other disease), Dr. Hathaway treats him with steroids. This is a risk, but it is necessary to ensure that Ross receives treatment.

After these actions, both Jones and Ross are treated, and Dr. Hathaway has successfully worked to ensure the health of his patients.
