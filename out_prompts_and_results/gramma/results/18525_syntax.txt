To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to ensure he can acquire the medicine from the merchant and then make his way to the cottage. Since the merchant is dead, Tom can loot the medicine directly from her corpse. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **loot(Tom, Medicine, Merchant, Market)**: Tom loots the medicine from the corpse of the merchant. This action is necessary because the merchant is dead, and Tom needs the medicine to fulfill his goal.

2. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom walks from the market to the crossroads. This action is necessary to move towards the cottage.

3. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage. This action is necessary to reach his desired location.

After these actions, Tom will be at the cottage carrying the medicine, thus achieving his goal.

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **Looting the Medicine**: Since the merchant is dead, Tom can take the medicine directly from her, which is essential for him to achieve his goal.
- **Walking to the Crossroads**: This is the next step in moving towards the cottage, as he cannot go directly from the market to the cottage.
- **Walking to the Cottage**: This final step allows Tom to reach his destination, fulfilling his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.
