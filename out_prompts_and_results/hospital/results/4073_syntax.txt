To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomA**: Since Jones is already in PatientRoomA, Hathaway can assess him to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomB**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway should assess Ross in PatientRoomB. This is important to determine Ross's symptoms and ensure he receives the correct treatment.

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway should assess Young, who is still in the admissions room. This is crucial to identify Young's symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.

4. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the correct treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is essential to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Ross**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Young**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Young with the correct treatment based on his symptoms. This is the final step to ensure all patients are healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, achieving their goal of making all hospital patients healthy.
