### Story Completion

After admitting Ross to Exam Room B, Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room A. Since Young is the only patient in the room, Hathaway checks for symptoms. Young shows no symptoms of Flaze or Jarkis, so Hathaway concludes that Young is healthy. This reduces Hathaway's workload by one.

Next, Hathaway walks to the Admissions room to assess Jones, who is still waiting. Upon assessing Jones, Hathaway finds that Jones has a fever, indicating Flaze. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze, making Jones healthy. This reduces Hathaway's workload by one.

Finally, Hathaway returns to Exam Room B to assess Ross. Ross shows no symptoms of either disease, indicating he is also healthy. Hathaway treats Ross accordingly, reducing the workload by one more.

With all patients now healthy, Hathaway achieves their goal.
