In this story, Casey wants to be happy and also wants Blake to be happy. To achieve this, Casey needs to obtain the jewelry (I3) that Blake has, as that is what Blake wants. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **trade(C3, I2, C2, I3, R21)**: Casey (C3) trades the item (I2) they have, which is the chocolates, with Blake (C2) for the jewelry (I3) that Blake wants. This action takes place in the living room (R21).

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Casey now has the jewelry (I3) and is happy because they have what they want.
- Blake is also happy because they received the chocolates (I2) that they wanted from Casey.

This single action allows both Casey and Blake to achieve their happiness, fulfilling their goals.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C3, I2, C2, I3, R21)"]
}
``` 

Each action is necessary to ensure that Casey achieves their goal of happiness while also considering Blake's happiness, making it a mutually beneficial outcome.
