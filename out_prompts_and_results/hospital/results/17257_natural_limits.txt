Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room C, realizes that she needs to assess Young in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since her workload is at 3, she is at risk of making a mistake, but she prioritizes assessing Young to ensure he receives the correct treatment.

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess Young's condition directly.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A.**  
   - By assessing Young, Dr. Hathaway can identify whether he has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash). This is crucial for determining the appropriate treatment.

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room A.**  
   - Assuming Young has Flaze (fever), Dr. Hathaway administers antibiotics. This action is essential for achieving her goal of ensuring Young's health.

4. **Dr. Hathaway walks back to Patient Room C.**  
   - This action is not strictly necessary for achieving her goal but allows Dr. Hathaway to return to her duties and potentially assist other patients.

After these actions, Young is treated successfully, and Dr. Hathaway achieves her goal of ensuring that all patients are healthy.
