To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will take place:

1. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to reach his desired location, the cottage.

2. **Tom uses the medicine.**  
   - This action is included to signify that Tom has successfully completed his goal of carrying the medicine to the cottage.

The story is very short because Tom's goal is straightforward, and he only needs to walk to the cottage to achieve it. The other characters do not interfere with Tom's actions, as they are focused on their own goals.
