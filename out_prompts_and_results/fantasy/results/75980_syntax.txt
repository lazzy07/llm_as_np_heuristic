To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on her relationship with Rory, who is still alive and has the potential to make her happy. Since Talia is currently in the Village and Rory is in the Cave, we can have Talia travel to the Cave to be with Rory. Once there, Rory can propose marriage to Talia, and she can accept. This will make both of them happy, fulfilling Talia's goal.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels to the Cave to be with Rory. This is necessary for Talia to interact with Rory and potentially achieve happiness through marriage.
   
2. **propose(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: Rory proposes marriage to Talia. This action is essential as it is the first step towards making Talia happy.
   
3. **accept(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: Talia accepts Rory's marriage proposal. This is crucial as it leads to both characters achieving happiness.

4. **marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: Rory and Talia get married. This finalizes their relationship and ensures that Talia is happy.

By following these actions, Talia achieves her goal of happiness through marriage with Rory.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

Each action is necessary to ensure Talia's happiness, as it directly leads to her marrying Rory, which is her path to achieving her goal.
