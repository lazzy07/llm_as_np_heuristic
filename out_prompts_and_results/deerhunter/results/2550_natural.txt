To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while the clerk has the money. The most straightforward way for Bubba to achieve his goal is to steal the money from the clerk using the rifle.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba loads the ammunition into the rifle.**  
   - This action is necessary because Bubba needs a loaded rifle to threaten the clerk and steal the money.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having money.

3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - This action allows Bubba to escape with the stolen money, ensuring he is safe after committing the theft.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.
