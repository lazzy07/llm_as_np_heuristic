Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the dangerous surface of the planet, both aware of the imminent threat posed by the volcano. They have just made peace, and their friendship is a crucial foundation for their next actions. 

1. **Zoe and the Lizard walk together to the cave.** This action is necessary because the cave provides shelter from the dangers of the surface, including the potential eruption of the volcano. By moving to the cave, both characters can ensure their safety.

2. **Zoe and the Lizard enter the cave.** This action solidifies their safety as they are now in a protected location away from the dangers of the surface. 

3. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace again.** Although they are already friends, reaffirming their bond in the cave helps to strengthen their relationship and ensures that they remain allies, which is essential for their mutual goal of safety and friendship.

4. **The volcano erupts.** This event is crucial as it demonstrates the danger they have avoided by moving to the cave. The eruption would have been fatal if they had remained on the surface.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard celebrate their friendship in the cave.** This action signifies the achievement of their goals. They are now safe from the eruption, and their friendship has deepened, fulfilling both characters' desires to be healthy, safe, and to make friends.
