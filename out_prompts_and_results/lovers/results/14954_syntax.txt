To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want (I1 - jewelry). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **trade(C1, I1, C3, I3, R22)**: Alex (C1) trades the jewelry (I1) they want with Casey (C3) for the flowers (I3) that Casey wants. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they desire while also considering Casey's happiness.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: After the trade, Casey (C3) gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1). This action is necessary to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is jewelry.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.
