Zoe and the Lizard are currently in the cave, and they are not fighting. Since both characters want to be healthy and safe and to make friends, Zoe decides to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial because it aligns with both characters' goals of friendship and safety.

After making peace, Zoe and the Lizard can now communicate and understand each other's intentions better. However, the volcano on the surface is a looming threat. To escalate the tension and lead to a dramatic conclusion, Zoe decides to teleport back to the spaceship. This action makes the Lizard angry, which could lead to a conflict, but since they are now friends, it will not escalate to fighting.

While Zoe is on the spaceship, the Lizard remains on the surface. The volcano then erupts, which is a random event that leads to the demise of the Lizard, who is unable to escape in time. This ending fulfills the requirement of having a character die while also ensuring that Zoe and the Lizard had a moment of friendship before the tragic event.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)** - Zoe and the Lizard become friends, aligning with their goals of safety and friendship.
2. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)** - Zoe teleports to the spaceship, which angers the Lizard but does not lead to fighting due to their newfound friendship.
3. **begin_erupt(Surface)** - The volcano begins to erupt, creating a sense of urgency and danger.
4. **erupt(Surface)** - The volcano erupts, resulting in the Lizard's death.

This sequence of actions leads to the desired outcome of a character dying while also ensuring that Zoe and the Lizard made peace before the tragic event.
