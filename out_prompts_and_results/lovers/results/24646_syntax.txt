To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they receive the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves from the living room (R12) to the dining room (R22) where Alex and Blake are located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with them and potentially receive the jewelry.

2. **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey. This action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be happy because they have given away the jewelry, which they were willing to do to make Casey happy.
- Blake will remain unhappy, but that does not affect Casey's goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken and their purpose:

1. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex and Blake to receive the jewelry.
2. **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry to Casey, fulfilling Casey's desire and making them happy.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:
