To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation indicates that Casey (C3) has the item they want (I3), which is the chocolates, and Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1). However, Alex is currently unhappy because they do not have the jewelry.

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve the goal:

1. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the bathroom (R12) to check for the jewelry.
   - This action is necessary for Casey to potentially find the jewelry.

2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I2) in the bathroom.
   - This action allows Casey to acquire the jewelry, which is what Alex wants.

3. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the dining room (R22) with the jewelry.
   - This action is necessary for Casey to return to where Alex and Blake are.

4. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I2) to Alex.
   - This action fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.

5. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves to the bathroom (R12) to check for the chocolates.
   - This action is necessary for Alex to find the chocolates, which is what Blake wants.

6. **pick_up(C1, I3, R12)**: Alex picks up the chocolates (I3) in the bathroom.
   - This action allows Alex to acquire the chocolates, which is what Blake wants.

7. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves back to the dining room (R22) with the chocolates.
   - This action is necessary for Alex to return to where Blake is.

8. **give(C1, I3, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I3) to Blake.
   - This action fulfills Blake's desire for the chocolates, making Blake happy.

Now, all characters are happy: Alex has the jewelry they wanted, Blake has the chocolates they wanted, and Casey has the chocolates they wanted.
