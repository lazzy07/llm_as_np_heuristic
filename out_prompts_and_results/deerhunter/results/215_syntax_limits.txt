To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following actions will be taken:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This is necessary because he needs a loaded gun to either shoot Bambi or to threaten the bank clerk if he decides to go back to the bank.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba shoots Bambi in the forest. This action directly leads to Bambi being dead, which is one of the conditions for the story's ending.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba decides to get money. This action reflects Bubba's greed and his desire to acquire money, which he can do after ensuring Bambi is dead.

4. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba goes to the bank. This action is necessary for him to confront the bank clerk and potentially take the money.

5. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals the money from the bank clerk while threatening him with the rifle. This action fulfills the condition of Bubba having the money.
