To achieve Blake's goal of being happy while also ensuring Alex is happy, we need to focus on the items they want. Blake wants to make Alex happy by giving them the item they desire, which is the flowers (I1). 

Here's the completed story:

1. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary for Blake to pick up the chocolates and later give them to Alex.
   
2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Blake picks up the chocolates. This is essential because Blake needs to have the chocolates to give them to Alex.

3. **move(C2, R21, R12)**: Blake returns to the living room where Alex is located. This is necessary for Blake to interact with Alex.

4. **give(C2, I2, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the chocolates to Alex. This action is crucial because it makes Alex happy, fulfilling Blake's goal of making Alex happy.

5. **move(C1, R12, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room to pick up the flowers (I1). This is necessary for Alex to obtain the item they want.

6. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the flowers. This is essential for Alex to achieve happiness.

7. **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex returns to the living room. This is necessary for Alex to be in the same room as Blake.

8. **give(C1, I1, C3, R12)**: Alex gives the flowers to Casey. This action is crucial because it makes Casey happy, which in turn makes Blake happy as well.

Now, all characters are happy: 
- Alex has the flowers (I1).
- Blake has the chocolates (I2).
- Casey has the flowers (I1).

### Explanation of Actions:
