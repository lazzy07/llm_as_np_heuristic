To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The bandit is already at the market, so she will walk to the crossroads to be closer to Tom and the merchant.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Merchant)**: The bandit will then walk to the merchant's location to confront her.

3. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Merchant)**: The bandit will rob Tom, who is at the merchant's location and is not armed. This action allows the bandit to take the coins that Tom is carrying.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp to maximize her coin collection.

This sequence of actions ensures that the bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Walking to the Crossroads and then to the Merchant**: This is necessary for the bandit to reach Tom and the merchant, where the action of robbing can take place.
- **Robbing Tom**: This action is crucial as it allows the bandit to acquire coins without becoming a criminal in the eyes of the guard, since Tom is not armed.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This final action ensures that the bandit maximizes her coin collection, fulfilling her goal.
