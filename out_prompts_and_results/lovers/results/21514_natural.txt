To achieve Alex's goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Casey gives the flowers to Alex.**  
   - This action is necessary because Alex wants the flowers, and Casey currently has them. By giving the flowers to Alex, Casey can help Alex achieve happiness.

2. **Casey moves from the bathroom to the living room.**  
   - This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's goal but helps to set up the next action. It allows Casey to be in a different room, potentially to interact with Blake later.

3. **Blake moves from the living room to the bathroom.**  
   - This action is also not strictly necessary for Alex's goal but helps to create a dynamic where Blake can interact with Casey or Alex later.

4. **Blake gives the chocolates to Casey.**  
   - This action is not necessary for Alex's goal but helps Blake achieve happiness by giving Casey the chocolates, which Blake believes Casey wants.

5. **Casey moves from the living room to the dining room.**  
   - This action is not necessary for Alex's goal but allows Casey to be in a position to potentially interact with Blake or Alex later.

6. **Blake moves from the bathroom to the living room.**  
   - This action is not necessary for Alex's goal but allows Blake to be in a position to interact with Casey or Alex later.

7. **Casey moves from the dining room to the living room.**  
   - This action is not necessary for Alex's goal but allows Casey to be in a position to interact with Blake.

8. **Blake gives the chocolates to Alex.**  
   - This action is not necessary for Alex's goal but helps Blake achieve happiness by giving Alex the chocolates, which Blake believes Alex wants.

At the end of these actions, Alex has the flowers and is happy, achieving their goal.
