Tom, armed with the merchant's sword, stands at the market, eyeing the merchant who has the medicine he desires. Knowing that the guard is also present, Tom decides to take a risk. He approaches the merchant and, with a swift motion, he robs her of the medicine she is carrying. 

This action is necessary for Tom to achieve his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine. By robbing the merchant, he secures the item he needs without needing to engage in a more complex series of actions that could attract the guard's attention.

After successfully robbing the merchant, Tom quickly walks back to the crossroads and then heads straight to the cottage, where he can finally fulfill his goal of being there with the medicine.
