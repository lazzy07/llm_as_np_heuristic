In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are gathered. Alex is happy because they have the flowers, which they wanted. However, Blake and Casey are not happy because they do not have the items they desire. Blake wants the chocolates, which are in the dining room, and Casey wants the jewelry, which is currently in the living room.

To help Casey achieve their goal, Casey can take the following action:

1. **Casey picks up the jewelry in the living room.** This action allows Casey to obtain the item they want, making them happy.

After this action, the situation is as follows: 
- Alex is still happy with the flowers.
- Blake is still not happy because they do not have the chocolates.
- Casey is now happy because they have the jewelry.

This action is necessary because it directly leads to Casey achieving their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:
