Zoe, the space explorer, is currently in a cave on the planet, while the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, is on the surface. Both characters want to be healthy and safe and to make friends with each other. To achieve this, Zoe needs to establish a friendly relationship with the Lizard.

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe initiates a peace-making action to establish a friendship with the Lizard. This action is crucial because it directly addresses both characters' goals of making friends and ensures they are not fighting.

2. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: After making peace, Zoe walks from the cave to the surface where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary for Zoe to be in the same location as the Lizard to further solidify their friendship.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once on the surface, Zoe makes peace again with the Lizard. This reinforces their friendship and ensures that both characters feel safe and healthy together.

At this point, Zoe has successfully made friends with the Lizard, achieving her goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:
