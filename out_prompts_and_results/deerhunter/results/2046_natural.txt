To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The following actions will help Bubba achieve this goal:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the bank where the clerk is located, as he needs to interact with the clerk to obtain money.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk. This action directly helps Bubba achieve his goal of having 1 money.

3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - After stealing the money, Bubba returns to the forest. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving his goal but provides closure to the story by returning him to his original location.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **Go to the bank:** Bubba needs to reach the bank to interact with the clerk.
2. **Steal the money:** This action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money.
3. **Return to the forest:** This action concludes the story by bringing Bubba back to his original location.
