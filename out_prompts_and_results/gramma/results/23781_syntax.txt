To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit will walk to the Market to potentially find more coins or interact with the Merchant. This action is necessary as it brings the Bandit closer to the Merchant, who is at the Crossroads.

2. **report(Merchant, spot: Bandit, place: Guard)**: The Merchant will report the Bandit’s location to the Guard. This action is crucial because it helps the Merchant avoid any criminal activity and potentially leads to the Bandit being dealt with by the Guard.

3. **walk(Guard, Market, Crossroads)**: The Guard will walk to the Crossroads after receiving the report from the Merchant. This action is necessary for the Guard to confront the Bandit.

4. **attack(Guard, Bandit, Crossroads)**: The Guard will attack the Bandit at the Crossroads. This action is essential as it eliminates the Bandit, who is a criminal, thus allowing the Merchant to operate freely without fear of robbery.

5. **loot(Merchant, BanditSword, Bandit, Crossroads)**: After the Bandit is defeated, the Merchant will loot the Bandit for her sword. This action is important as it allows the Merchant to gain an item that could potentially help her in future dealings.

6. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant will then walk back to the Market. This action is necessary for her to continue her business and potentially sell items or acquire more coins.

7. **buy(Merchant, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: Finally, the Merchant will buy the coin from Tom using her own coins. This action is crucial as it directly contributes to her goal of acquiring more coins.

By following this sequence of actions, the Merchant successfully avoids criminality while maximizing her coin collection.
