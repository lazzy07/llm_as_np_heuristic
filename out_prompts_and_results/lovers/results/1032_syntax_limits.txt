In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is I1 (flowers). 

Given the current situation, the following actions will help Blake achieve their goal:

1. **move(C2, R21, R12)**: Blake moves from the dining room (R21) to the living room (R12) where Alex is located. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as Alex to help them.

2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the flowers (I1) to Alex (C1) in the living room (R12). This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be happy because they have the flowers they wanted.
- Blake will also be happy because they achieved their goal of making Alex happy.

Hereâ€™s the explanation of the actions:
- The first action is necessary for Blake to reach Alex, as they cannot give the item from a different room.
- The second action is crucial as it directly satisfies Alex's desire, thus fulfilling Blake's goal.
