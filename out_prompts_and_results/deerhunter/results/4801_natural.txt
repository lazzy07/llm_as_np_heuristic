To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the forest, has a rifle loaded with ammunition, and is hungry. The clerk is at the bank with 1 money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **Bubba decides to get money.** - This action is necessary as it aligns with Bubba's goal of wanting to have money.
2. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - Bubba needs to go to the bank to confront the clerk and obtain the money.
3. **Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.** - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk to take the money.
4. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can pick up the money to achieve his goal.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Deciding to get money** is the first step as it sets Bubba's intention to achieve his goal.
- **Going to the bank** is necessary for Bubba to interact with the clerk, who has the money.
- **Shooting the clerk** is a direct action that allows Bubba to take the money, as he has the means (the loaded rifle) to do so.
- **Picking up the money** is the final action that fulfills Bubba's goal of having 1 money.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "decide to get money",
    "go from the forest to the bank",
    "shoot the clerk with the rifle",
    "pick up the money from the clerk"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba successfully achieves his goal of having 1 money.
