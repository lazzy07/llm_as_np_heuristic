In the current situation, Alex (C1) is happy because they have the item they want (I1 - jewelry). However, Casey (C3) is not happy because they want I3 (flowers), and Blake (C2) is also not happy because they want I2 (chocolates). To ensure that Alex achieves their goal of making Casey happy, Alex can take the following action:

1. **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the flowers (I3) to Casey (C3) in the living room (R22). This action is necessary because it directly addresses Casey's desire for flowers, making Casey happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex (C1) will still be happy because they have I1 (jewelry).
- Casey (C3) will now be happy because they have I3 (flowers).
- Blake (C2) will remain unhappy because they still want I2 (chocolates).

However, since Alex's goal is to make Casey happy, this action successfully fulfills that objective.
