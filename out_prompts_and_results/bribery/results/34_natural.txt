To complete the story with the villain controlling the president, we need to ensure that the villain maintains their control over the president while also achieving their goal of having the money. The hero's actions will be limited since they are coerced and fearful of the villain. 

Here’s the completed story:

1. The villain threatens the hero again, reinforcing their power and control.
2. The villain coerces the hero into giving up the remaining Money they have.
3. The villain gives Money to the President, solidifying their control over him.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **The villain threatens the hero again**: This action is necessary to maintain the villain's dominance over the hero, ensuring that the hero remains compliant and fearful, which is crucial for the villain's plans.
   
2. **The villain coerces the hero into giving up the remaining Money**: This action allows the villain to consolidate their power by ensuring they have all the money, which is essential for their control over the president and their ultimate goal.

3. **The villain gives Money to the President**: By giving money to the president, the villain reinforces their control over him. The president, now having received money from the villain, is further bound to the villain's influence and desires.

At the end of these actions, the villain successfully controls the president, achieving their goal.
