**Story Completion:**

1. **Admit(Hathaway, Young, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway admits Young to exam room C. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment. It also increases Hathaway's workload to 3, which is important for the next step.

2. **Assess(Hathaway, Young, SymptomA, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Young in exam room C. This action is crucial because it allows Hathaway to determine Young's symptoms, which will inform the treatment decision. Since Young's symptoms are unknown, this assessment is necessary to ensure Hathaway can provide the correct treatment.

3. **Treat(Hathaway, Young, Steroids, PatientRoomC)**: After assessing Young, Hathaway treats them with steroids, assuming Young has Jarkis (the rash). This action is essential for achieving Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy. If Young indeed has Jarkis, this treatment will make them healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action of admitting Young is necessary to ensure that all patients are in the correct location for assessment and treatment.
- The second action of assessing Young is critical to identify the symptoms and determine the appropriate treatment.
- The final action of treating Young with steroids is aimed at curing Young's condition, thereby fulfilling Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
