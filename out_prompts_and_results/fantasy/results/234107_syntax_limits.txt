To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following action is taken:

1. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels to the Cave where Gargax is located. This is necessary because Gargax is the only character who can help Talia achieve her goal of wealth by potentially giving her money or treasure.

2. **eat(Gargax, Talia, Cave)**: Gargax eats Talia. This action is included because, in this scenario, Talia's goal of being wealthy is prioritized over her happiness. By being eaten, Talia's wealth (the treasure she possesses) can be transferred to Gargax, who desires wealth. This action ultimately leads to Talia's goal of being wealthy, albeit at the cost of her life.

In this story, Talia's actions lead to her achieving her goal of wealth, even if it comes with the consequence of her demise.
