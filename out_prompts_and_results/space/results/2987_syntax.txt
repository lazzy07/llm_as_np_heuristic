To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will walk back to the cave to ensure it is in a safer location away from the erupting volcano. This action is necessary for the Lizard to maintain its safety.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will follow the Lizard to the cave. This action is important for Zoe to stay close to the Lizard and continue building their friendship.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: In the cave, Zoe will make peace with the Lizard again. This action solidifies their friendship and ensures that both characters are no longer in conflict, which is essential for both of them to feel safe and healthy.

4. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard will walk back to the surface to check on the volcano. This action is necessary for the Lizard to ensure that the area is safe and to monitor the situation.

5. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe will follow the Lizard back to the surface. This action keeps them together and allows them to support each other.

6. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both characters are now friends and have been monitoring the situation, they can quickly teleport to safety.

7. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Zoe will teleport to the spaceship for safety. This action is crucial for her to avoid danger from the eruption.

8. **teleport_to_ship(Lizard, Surface, Ship)**: The Lizard will also teleport to the spaceship. This action ensures that the Lizard is safe from the eruption as well.

By following these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also fostering their friendship.
