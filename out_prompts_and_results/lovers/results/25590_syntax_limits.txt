In the current situation, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. Alex is currently unhappy because they want item I3 (chocolates), which is with Casey. To help Alex, Blake can take action to give Alex the item they want.

**Story Completion:**

1. **give(Blake, I3, Alex, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I3) to Alex. This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making Alex happy. Since Blake wants Alex to be happy, this action also fulfills Blake's goal.

After this action, the situation changes as follows:
- at(C1) = R22; at(C2) = R22; at(C3) = R22; at(I1) = C1; at(I2) = ?; at(I3) = C1; happy(C1) = True; happy(C2) = False; happy(C3) = False; wants(C1) = I3; wants(C2) = I2; wants(C3) = I3; 

Now, Alex is happy because they have the chocolates they wanted, and Blake is also happy because they achieved their goal of making Alex happy.
