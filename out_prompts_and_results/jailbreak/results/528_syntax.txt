**Story Completion:**

1. **Action: disguise(Roy, Clothes, Hall)**  
   - Roy puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry. This action is necessary for him to disguise himself and prepare for his escape.

2. **Action: escape(Roy, Highway)**  
   - After disguising himself, Roy moves to the highway and successfully escapes from the prison. This action fulfills Roy's goal of wanting to be alive and not threatened.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action is crucial because without the disguise, Roy would be easily recognized as a prisoner and would not be able to escape safely. The second action is the culmination of his efforts to achieve freedom, ensuring he is no longer threatened by the bully or the prison environment.
