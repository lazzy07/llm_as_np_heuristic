To ensure Rory achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Rory needs to return to the village to interact with Vince, who has the money. This is essential for Rory to become wealthy.

2. **Rory proposes to Vince.**  
   - Since Rory is already married to Talia, he can propose to Vince to create a bond that could lead to a mutually beneficial arrangement. This action is necessary for Rory to achieve happiness through companionship.

3. **Vince accepts Rory's proposal.**  
   - Vince, who is not hungry and wants to be happy, accepts the proposal, which increases both characters' happiness.

4. **Rory and Vince get married.**  
   - This solidifies their relationship, ensuring Rory's happiness is achieved through companionship.

5. **Rory takes the money from Vince.**  
   - Since Vince has the money, Rory takes it to fulfill his goal of being wealthy.

6. **Rory's wealth increases.**  
   - With the money taken from Vince, Rory now has wealth, achieving his goal of being wealthy.

At this point, Rory is happy (due to his marriage to Vince) and wealthy (due to taking the money), thus achieving his goals.
