1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want to interact with.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the flowers (I1) from the dining room (R21). This is essential for Alex to obtain the item they desire.

4. **give(C1, I1, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the flowers (I1) to Casey (C3). This action is crucial because it allows Alex to fulfill their desire to make Casey happy, which in turn contributes to Alex's happiness.
