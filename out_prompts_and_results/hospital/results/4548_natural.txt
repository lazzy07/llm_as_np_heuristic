**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that Jones is experiencing a rash, decides to treat him for Jarkis, the disease associated with that symptom. However, with a workload of 3, there is a risk of making a mistake. To ensure that Jones receives the correct treatment, Hathaway first assesses Young, who is still in Admissions, to determine his symptoms.

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Hathaway to assess Young, as he needs to know if Young has any symptoms that could affect his treatment decisions.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young.**  
   - This action allows Hathaway to check Young's symptoms. If Young has a fever, it would indicate Flaze, and Hathaway would need to treat him accordingly. If Young has no symptoms, Hathaway can focus on treating Jones.

3. **Dr. Hathaway finds that Young is experiencing a fever.**  
   - This information is crucial because it confirms that Young has Flaze, allowing Hathaway to treat him correctly.

4. **Dr. Hathaway walks back to Patient Room A.**  
   - Hathaway needs to return to Jones to treat him for Jarkis.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Jarkis.**  
   - Since Jones is experiencing a rash, this treatment is appropriate, and it will make Jones healthy.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.**  
   - After treating Jones, Hathaway can now treat Young for his fever, ensuring both patients are healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats both patients, achieving the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is designed to gather necessary information or provide treatment to the patients. The initial assessment of Young is critical to avoid misdiagnosing Jones due to Hathaway's high workload. The return to Patient Room A is essential for continuity in treatment, and the final treatments ensure both patients recover.
