Zoe, the space explorer, finds herself on the surface of the planet, aware that the volcano has begun to erupt. She knows she needs to make peace with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, to ensure both their safety. 

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and extends a hand of friendship, expressing her desire to work together for their mutual safety. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of making friends and being safe.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard, now feeling more amicable towards Zoe, decides to walk back to the cave to find shelter from the impending eruption. This action shows the Lizard's willingness to cooperate and seek safety.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: As the Lizard reaches the cave, the volcano erupts violently, causing destruction on the surface. This action fulfills the condition of the volcano erupting and leads to the demise of Zoe, who remains on the surface.

In this story, Zoe successfully makes peace with the Lizard, achieving her goal of friendship, but ultimately, she is unable to escape the eruption, leading to her demise. The Lizard, however, survives by moving to the cave.
