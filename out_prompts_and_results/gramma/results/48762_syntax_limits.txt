To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, he needs to walk back to the crossroads and then to the cottage. Since he already has the medicine, he can directly walk to the cottage without any further actions needed.

Here’s the complete story:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom is currently at the market and needs to return to the crossroads to head towards the cottage.
2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: After reaching the crossroads, Tom walks to the cottage, successfully achieving his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.

This story is short and direct, as it only includes the necessary actions for Tom to reach his goal without any unnecessary interactions with other characters or items.
