To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, they may make a mistake if they assess Jones without reducing their workload. However, Jones is in the admissions room, and Hathaway needs to assess him to determine his symptoms. 

2. **Walk from Admissions to Exam Room B**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway needs to walk to Exam Room B where Jones is assigned.

3. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Hathaway should assess Ross next, who is also in the admissions room. This will help determine Ross's symptoms.

4. **Walk from Admissions to Exam Room A**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway needs to walk to Exam Room A where Ross is assigned.

5. **Treat Young in Exam Room C**: Since Young has already been assessed and has SymptomB, Hathaway can treat Young with the appropriate treatment for SymptomB (which is not specified but assumed to be correct).

6. **Treat Jones in Exam Room B**: After assessing Jones and determining his symptoms, Hathaway can treat him accordingly.

7. **Treat Ross in Exam Room A**: Finally, Hathaway treats Ross based on the assessment done earlier.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are treated correctly, thus achieving their goal of making all hospital patients healthy.
