To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to reach the merchant, who has the medicine.

2. **Tom robs the merchant of the medicine.**  
   - Since Tom is armed with a sword and the merchant is not, he can take the medicine from her. This is essential for Tom to achieve his goal of carrying the medicine.

3. **Tom walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - After acquiring the medicine, Tom needs to return to the crossroads to get closer to the cottage.

4. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - This final action allows Tom to reach his goal of being at the cottage.

- He first goes to the market to rob the merchant of the medicine.
- After obtaining the medicine, he returns to the crossroads and then walks to the cottage.
