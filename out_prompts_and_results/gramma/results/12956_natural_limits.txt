The bandit, having just looted the hero's coin, sees the guard at the crossroads. Knowing that the guard is a threat to her freedom, she decides to take action. The bandit attacks the guard, using her sword to eliminate him. With the guard dead, the bandit now feels secure and can return to the bandit camp with the hero's coin and her own coins in the chest.

**Explanation of Actions:**
