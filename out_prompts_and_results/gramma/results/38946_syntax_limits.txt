In this story, the Bandit wants to be carrying as many coins as possible or have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. The Bandit is currently at the Market, where she has already robbed the Merchant of the Medicine. The Bandit also has a sword, which allows her to take actions against other characters.

To achieve her goal, the Bandit can take the following action:

1. **Take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will walk to the bandit camp and take the coins that are in the chest. This action directly fulfills her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

This is the only action needed to achieve the Bandit's goal, as it allows her to secure the coins without any conflict or additional steps.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **Take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to achieve her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Since she is already at the Market, she can simply walk to the bandit camp and take the coins.
