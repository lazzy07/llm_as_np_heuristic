**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is necessary to ensure that Dr. Hathaway can assess and treat all patients effectively. By admitting Jones to Patient Room C, Hathaway can then assess and treat him. The same process is followed for Young and Ross, ensuring that all patients receive the correct treatment for their respective diseases. The sequence of actions is designed to minimize Hathaway's workload while ensuring that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.
