**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the laundry, Ernest finds himself in the hallway, holding the pack of cigarettes he stole from the bully. He knows that the bully is in the gym and is currently occupied with his recreation time. Ernest decides to take advantage of this moment. He quickly crawls through the vents to reach the gym, where he can confront the bully.

Once inside the gym, Ernest locks the door behind him, ensuring that no one can interrupt their confrontation. With the knife he knows is in the kitchen, he has a plan to deal with the bully once and for all. He approaches the bully, who is surprised to see him. In a swift motion, Ernest takes out the knife and kills the bully, finally freeing himself and Roy from the constant threat.

With the bully out of the way, Ernest can now focus on escaping. He quickly changes into the civilian clothes he stole earlier, disguising himself.
