To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **Merchant walks from Crossroads to Market**: The Merchant needs to be at the Market to sell her items and interact with Tom, who is currently there.

2. **Merchant buys the medicine from Tom using a coin**: The Merchant will buy the medicine from Tom, giving him one of her coins. This action allows her to acquire the medicine while also reducing her coin count, but it is a legitimate transaction.
