To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: Since Jones is in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room yet, Hathaway should assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to understand if Jones has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Assess Ross**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway should assess Ross in the admissions room as well. This will help determine Ross's symptoms and ensure he receives the correct treatment.

3. **Assess Young**: Finally, Hathaway should assess Young, who is also in the admissions room. This will complete the assessment of all patients.

4. **Admit Jones to Exam Room C**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway can admit him to Exam Room C based on his symptoms.

5. **Admit Ross to Exam Room A**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway can admit him to Exam Room A based on his symptoms.

6. **Admit Young to Exam Room B**: After assessing Young, Hathaway can admit him to Exam Room B based on his symptoms.

7. **Treat Jones**: Once Jones is in Exam Room C, Hathaway can treat him with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.

8. **Treat Ross**: After treating Jones, Hathaway can treat Ross in Exam Room A with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.
