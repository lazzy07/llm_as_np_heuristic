To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit robs the merchant.** The bandit, armed with a sword, can rob the merchant who is unarmed. This action allows the bandit to take the hero's coin from the merchant, increasing her wealth.

2. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.** After robbing the merchant, the bandit will walk back to her camp, where she can store the coin in the chest, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

This sequence of actions is necessary for the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying coins or having them in her camp. The first action directly increases her coin count, while the second action ensures that the coins are safely stored in her camp.

Here’s the complete story:

1. The bandit, armed with her sword, approaches the merchant at the market.
2. The bandit robs the merchant, taking the hero's coin.
3. With the coin in her possession, the bandit walks back to the bandit camp, where she places the coin in the chest.

The bandit now has achieved her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
