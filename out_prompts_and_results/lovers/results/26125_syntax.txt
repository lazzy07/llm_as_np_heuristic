3. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the bedroom (R22) where the flowers are located. This is necessary for Casey to be able to pick up the flowers.

4. **pick_up(C2, I1, R22)**: Casey picks up the flowers from the bedroom. This is crucial because it allows Casey to have the item that Alex wants.
