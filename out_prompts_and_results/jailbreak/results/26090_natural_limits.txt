Ernest, realizing he is locked in the gym with the bully, decides to take action. He knows that the bully is a threat to both him and Roy, and he has the knife in his possession. With no other options available and the need to protect himself and his friend, Ernest uses the knife to kill the bully. 

After successfully eliminating the threat, Ernest takes a moment to catch his breath. He then quickly puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier, disguising himself. With the gym door still locked, he sneaks through the vent to the hallway, where he can finally make his escape.
