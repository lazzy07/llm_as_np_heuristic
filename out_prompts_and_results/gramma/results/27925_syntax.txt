To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit moves to the Market, where she can potentially find more coins or interact with the Merchant.
2. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant moves from the Camp to the Crossroads, where she can encounter Tom and the Bandit.
3. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit, armed with a sword, robs Tom, taking the coin he has. This action is necessary for the Bandit to increase her coin count, but it also indirectly benefits the Merchant by creating a distraction.
4. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant moves to the Market, where she can sell her items or interact with the Guard.
5. **buy(Merchant, BanditSword, MerchantCoin, Market)**: The Merchant uses the coin she has to buy the Bandit's sword. This action allows her to increase her power and potentially defend herself against any threats.

At this point, the Merchant has successfully acquired a sword and has not engaged in any criminal activity, thus achieving her goal of maximizing her coins without becoming a criminal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Bandit moving to the Market creates a situation where she can rob Tom, which is essential for her character's goal but also serves to distract the Merchant.
- The Merchant moving to the Crossroads allows her to be in a position to interact with both Tom and the Bandit.
- The robbery by the Bandit is crucial as it increases her coin count, which indirectly benefits the Merchant by creating a chaotic environment.
- The Merchant's final action of buying the sword is a strategic move to ensure her safety and increase her power without crossing into criminality.
