To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). Since Alex is currently in the bedroom (R11) and believes that the flowers are with Casey (C3), the most efficient action is for Alex to move to the room where Casey is located (R21) and then take the flowers from Casey.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Action: move(Alex, R11, R21)** - Alex moves from the bedroom to the living room where Casey is located. This action is necessary for Alex to be in the same room as Casey to obtain the flowers.

2. **Action: pick_up(Alex, I1, R21)** - Alex picks up the flowers from Casey. This action is crucial as it allows Alex to acquire the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(Alex, R11, R21)**: This action is necessary for Alex to reach Casey, who has the flowers. Without this movement, Alex cannot interact with Casey to obtain the item they desire.
- **pick_up(Alex, I1, R21)**: This action allows Alex to take the flowers from Casey, fulfilling their desire and making them happy.
