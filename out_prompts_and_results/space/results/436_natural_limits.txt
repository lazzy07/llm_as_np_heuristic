Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to take action. She teleports from the surface to the spaceship to assess the situation and gather her thoughts. This action is necessary because it allows her to escape the immediate danger of the volcano and think strategically about how to approach the Lizard.

Once on the spaceship, Zoe reflects on her goal of making friends with the Lizard. She decides to teleport back to the surface, hoping to communicate with the Lizard and establish a friendship. However, this action makes the Lizard angry, as it perceives Zoe's teleportation as a threat to its guardianship of the surface.

Upon arriving back on the surface, Zoe finds the Lizard has come out of the cave, ready to confront her. Instead of fighting, Zoe chooses to make peace, extending a hand of friendship. The Lizard, recognizing Zoe's intentions and understanding the mutual goal of safety and health, accepts her offer. They both realize that they can work together to ensure the safety of the planet and its inhabitants.

However, as they are making peace, the volcano erupts, and Zoe is caught in the eruption, leading to her demise. This ending fulfills the requirement of a character dying while also allowing for the two characters to have made friends before the tragic event.
