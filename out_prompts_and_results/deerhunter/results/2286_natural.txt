To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. Since Bubba already has 1 money, he does not need to take any further actions to achieve his goal. The story can conclude with Bubba satisfied with his current situation.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

Bubba stands in the forest, feeling satisfied after his recent actions. He has successfully shot Bambi, and now he has 1 money in his possession. He is hungry but knows he can eat later. For now, he feels accomplished and does not need to return to the bank or take any further actions. He believes he is alive, has the rifle, and has achieved his goal of having 1 money.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **No further actions are needed**: Bubba already has 1 money, which is his goal. Therefore, there is no need for him to go back to the bank, steal more money, or engage in any other actions that could complicate the situation.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": []
}
``` 

This indicates that no additional actions are required for Bubba to achieve his goal, as he is already in a satisfactory position.
