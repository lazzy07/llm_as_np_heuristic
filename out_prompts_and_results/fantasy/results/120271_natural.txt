To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the story will focus on her actions to secure her wealth and happiness. Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Talia travels from the cave to the village.** (Talia needs to be in the village to interact with Rory and Vince.)
2. **Talia proposes marriage to Rory.** (Talia wants to be happy, and marrying Rory will increase her happiness.)
3. **Rory accepts Talia's proposal.** (This action will make both Talia and Rory happy.)
4. **Talia proposes marriage to Vince.** (Talia wants to maximize her happiness and wealth, so she proposes to Vince as well.)
5. **Vince accepts Talia's proposal.** (This will also make Talia happy, fulfilling her goal.)
6. **Talia picks up the money from Vince.** (Talia needs to increase her wealth, and since Vince has the money, she takes it.)
7. **Talia travels from the village to the cave.** (Talia needs to return to the cave to be with Vince and Gargax.)
8. **Gargax eats Talia.** (This action is necessary to fulfill the story's requirements, but it does not affect Talia's happiness or wealth since she has already achieved her goals before this point.)

### Explanation of Actions:
