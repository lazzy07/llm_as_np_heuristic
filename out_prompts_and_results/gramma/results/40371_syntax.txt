To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant at the Crossroads to take the coins she is carrying. This action is necessary because the Bandit wants to increase her coin count without needing to go back to the camp.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will walk back to the Camp. This action is necessary to secure the coins in the chest at the bandit camp, fulfilling her goal.

The story unfolds as follows:

- The Bandit, having just attacked Tom, sees the Merchant at the Crossroads. Knowing that the Merchant is unarmed, she decides to rob her. The Bandit successfully takes the coins from the Merchant, increasing her wealth.
- With the coins in hand, the Bandit then walks back to the Bandit Camp, where she can store the coins in the chest, achieving her goal of having coins secured.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **rob**: This action is crucial for the Bandit to acquire coins without becoming a criminal in the eyes of the law, as the Merchant is not armed.
- **walk**: This action is necessary for the Bandit to return to her camp and secure her newly acquired coins.
