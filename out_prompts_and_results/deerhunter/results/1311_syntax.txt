To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will shoot the bank clerk to steal the money. This action is necessary because the clerk has money, and Bubba needs to eliminate the threat to take it.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After obtaining the money, Bubba will go to the forest to eat Bambi. This action is included because Bubba is hungry and needs to satisfy that hunger.
