To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is I3 (the chocolates). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **trade(C2, I3, C1, I1, R22)**: Blake (C2) will trade the chocolates (I3) they have with Alex (C1) for the jewelry (I1) that Alex has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, which is the chocolates.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the chocolates (I3) and will be happy.
- Blake will have the jewelry (I1) and will also be happy since they have traded an item they were willing to give up.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken and their purpose:

1. **trade(C2, I3, C1, I1, R22)**: This action allows Alex to get the chocolates they want, fulfilling their desire for happiness.

At this point, Alex is happy because they have the chocolates, and the story ends here.
