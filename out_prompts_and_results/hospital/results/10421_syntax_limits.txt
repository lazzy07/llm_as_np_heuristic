To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Since Ross is currently in the admissions room and has not been assessed yet, Hathaway will assess him to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to understand what treatment he needs.

2. **Assess Young in Admissions**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will assess Young, who is also in the admissions room. This will allow Hathaway to identify Young's symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.

3. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: If Ross is diagnosed with Jarkis (which has a rash as a symptom), Hathaway will treat him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis.

4. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young is also diagnosed with Jarkis, Hathaway will treat him with steroids as well.

5. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: Since Jones has already been assessed and has a fever (symptom of Flaze), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics to ensure he becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are treated correctly based on their symptoms, leading to their recovery.

### Explanation of Actions:
