Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, decides to take action to achieve his goal of obtaining money. He knows that the bank clerk has money, and since he has a loaded rifle, he can use it to intimidate the clerk. 

Bubba points the rifle at the clerk and demands the money. The clerk, fearing for his life, hands over the 1 money to Bubba. Now, Bubba has achieved his goal of having 1 money.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Bubba shoots the clerk**: This action is necessary for Bubba to obtain the money, as he is greedy and wants to have it. However, since the goal is to achieve the ending where Bubba has money without unnecessary violence, we can instead have him simply demand the money, which is implied in the action of intimidation.

The story can be completed in one action:

1. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This action is taken because Bubba has a loaded rifle, allowing him to steal the money without needing to shoot the clerk.
