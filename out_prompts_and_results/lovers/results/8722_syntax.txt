To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will be taken:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room where the flowers are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the flowers to pick them up.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the flowers. This action is essential for Alex to achieve happiness since they want the flowers.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room where Casey and Blake are. This is to share their happiness with the others.

4. **tell(C1, C2, I1, R22)**: Alex tells Casey that they have the flowers. This action is to communicate their happiness and potentially influence Casey's feelings.

5. **tell(C1, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex tells Blake that they have the flowers. This is to ensure that Blake is aware of Alex's happiness, which may also affect Blake's feelings.
