To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit robs the hero.** The bandit uses her sword to rob the hero, taking the merchant's sword. This action is necessary because the bandit needs to increase her power and potentially gain more items to help her achieve her goal.

2. **The bandit attacks the hero.** After robbing the hero, the bandit attacks and kills the hero. This action is crucial because it eliminates a non-criminal threat and allows the bandit to loot the hero's items.

3. **The bandit loots the hero's corpse.** The bandit takes the hero's coin from the hero's body. This action directly contributes to the bandit's goal of carrying more coins.
