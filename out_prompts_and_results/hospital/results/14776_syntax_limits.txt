In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is determined to ensure all patients are healthy. The current situation involves Ross, who is in Exam Room A with a symptom (SymptomA) that Hathaway has assessed. To achieve the goal of making all patients healthy, Hathaway will need to treat Ross appropriately.

1. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, believing that Ross has Flaze due to the fever symptom. Since Ross is in Exam Room A and has been assessed with SymptomA, Hathaway will treat him with the correct medication. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Ross's health issue, ensuring he becomes healthy.

2. **walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomA, Admissions)**: After treating Ross, Hathaway walks to the Admissions room to check on the other patients, Jones and Young, who are currently unassigned and waiting. This action is necessary for Hathaway to assess their conditions and ensure they receive the appropriate care.

3. **admit(Hathaway, Young, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway admits Young to Exam Room B. This action is important as it allows Hathaway to manage Young's care and ensure he is treated promptly, contributing to the overall goal of making all patients healthy.

By performing these actions, Hathaway successfully treats Ross and prepares to address the needs of the other patients, ensuring that all patients will be healthy.
