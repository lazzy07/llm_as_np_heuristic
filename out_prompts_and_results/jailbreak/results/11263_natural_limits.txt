**Story Completion:**

As the first day in the prison continued, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, knew he had to act quickly. He decided to crawl through the vents from the hallway to the gym, where the bully was. 

Once in the gym, Roy locked the door behind him, ensuring that they were alone. He then confronted the bully, who was unaware of Roy's presence. With the knife he had stolen earlier, Roy took a deep breath and killed the bully, finally freeing himself and Ernest from the constant threat.

With the bully out of the way, Roy could now escape the prison. He quickly made his way back to the hallway, where he put on the civilian clothes again to ensure he was fully disguised. Finally, he exited through the highway, successfully escaping the prison.
