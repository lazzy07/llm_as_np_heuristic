In the current situation, Blake (C3) is already happy because they have the item they want (I3). However, Alex (C1) and Casey (C2) are not happy because they do not have the items they want (I1 and I2, respectively). To ensure that Blake achieves their goal of making Alex happy, Blake can give Alex the item they want (I1).

Hereâ€™s the action that Blake will take:

1. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the flowers (I1) to Alex (C1) in the living room (R22). This action makes Alex happy because they now have the item they want.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex (C1) is now happy because they have the flowers (I1).
- Casey (C2) is still unhappy because they do not have the item they want (I2).
- Blake (C3) remains happy because they still have the jewelry (I3).

This single action is sufficient for Blake to achieve their goal of making Alex happy.
